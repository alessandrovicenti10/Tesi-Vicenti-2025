    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave carbon footprint for the iPhone 16 128GB is approximately 80 kg CO₂e. This estimate is based on publicly available data from Apple’s Environmental Progress Reports and third-party lifecycle assessments of similar smartphones. The calculation includes raw material extraction (metals, plastics, glass), manufacturing processes, global transportation, use-phase energy consumption over an average 4-year lifespan (assuming typical daily usage and European electricity grid mix), and end-of-life disposal or recycling. Official Apple disclosures indicate a focus on reducing supply chain emissions, but comprehensive lifecycle data remains limited; thus, the estimate incorporates typical industry averages for similar devices. The use of ecoinvent v3.10 datasets for material and manufacturing emissions, combined with standard use-phase energy consumption figures, supports this approximation. This figure is indicative and subject to variation based on specific supply chain conditions, regional energy mixes, and end-of-life management practices."

    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave carbon footprint for the iPhone 16e 128GB is approximately 55 kg CO₂e. This estimate is based on publicly available data for similar smartphones, including manufacturer disclosures and peer-reviewed LCA studies. The calculation accounts for raw material extraction (metals, plastics, glass), manufacturing processes, global transportation, use-phase energy consumption over an average 4-year lifespan (assuming typical daily usage and a standard EU electricity grid mix), and end-of-life disposal or recycling. Official EPDs for comparable Apple models indicate emissions in the range of 50–60 kg CO₂e, which informed this estimate. The use-phase energy consumption was modeled using average smartphone power draw (~2W) over 4 years, with emissions calculated based on the EU grid emission factor (~0.3 kg CO₂e/kWh). Transport emissions were included based on global supply chain data. This figure is an approximation; actual emissions may vary depending on specific manufacturing locations, user behavior, and end-of-life treatment."
