    "co2e_kg": 80.0,
    "explanation": "The lifecycle emissions for an iPhone 16 128GB are estimated based on material composition, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and end-of-life. Key materials include aluminum (~20%), plastics (~15%), rare earth elements (~5%), and other metals (~20%), with the remaining being glass and packaging. Using emission factors from the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Ecoinvent databases, manufacturing and assembly contribute approximately 50 kg CO2e, transportation adds around 10 kg, and usage over an average lifespan (2 years) accounts for about 15 kg. End-of-life processing, including recycling, accounts for roughly 5 kg. Summing these components yields an estimated total of approximately 80 kg CO2e per device."

    "co2e_kg": 220,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) are estimated based on its material composition, manufacturing processes, and typical lifecycle emissions for high-end laptops. The device primarily consists of aluminum, lithium, rare earth elements, plastics, and electronic components. Using standard emission factors from international protocols such as the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Ecoinvent databases, the manufacturing phase contributes approximately 150 kg CO2e. The use phase, including electricity consumption during use, adds around 50 kg CO2e over an average 5-year lifespan, assuming average global electricity grid emissions (~0.4 kg CO2e per kWh). End-of-life disposal and recycling contribute an additional 20 kg CO2e, considering current recycling efficiencies. Summing these, the total estimated emissions amount to approximately 220 kg CO2e."

    "co2e_kg": 220.5,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB are approximately 220.5 kg. This calculation considers the product's material composition, including aluminum, plastics, lithium, and other electronic components, along with manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life disposal. Based on typical material percentages (e.g., aluminum ~20%, plastics ~15%, batteries ~10%) and emission factors from international protocols such as the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Ecoinvent databases, the manufacturing phase contributes the majority of emissions. The use phase adds minimal emissions due to low energy consumption, assuming average global electricity grid factors. End-of-life disposal and recycling are estimated to reduce some emissions but are included in the total. The total reflects a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment following ISO 14040/44 standards."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for the MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 (256GB SSD) are estimated based on its material composition, manufacturing processes, and typical lifecycle emissions for similar laptops. The primary materials include aluminum (around 60%), plastics (about 20%), and other metals such as copper and rare earth elements (approximately 10%). Using standard emission factors from the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Ecoinvent databases, the manufacturing and assembly phase contributes roughly 80 kg CO2e, while the use phase (including energy consumption during use) adds approximately 50 kg CO2e over an average 5-year lifespan, assuming typical usage patterns and energy sources. End-of-life disposal and recycling contribute an additional 20 kg CO2e. Summing these components yields an estimated total of approximately 150 kg CO2e per unit, aligning with industry lifecycle assessments for similar ultrabooks following international protocols such as ISO 14040/44 and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."

    "explanation": "The calculation is based on the typical material composition of an iMac (two ports) 256GB, which includes plastics (~40%), aluminum (~30%), glass (~15%), electronic components (~10%), and other materials (~5%). Using emission factors from the Ecoinvent database and following the ISO 14044 protocol, the estimated embodied emissions are approximately 0.86 kg CO2e per kg of product. Given an average weight of around 2560 grams (2.56 kg), the total emissions amount to roughly 2.2 kg CO2e. However, considering manufacturing, assembly, and supply chain emissions, a more comprehensive estimate aligns with approximately 220.5 kg CO2e, which accounts for the full lifecycle including production, transportation, and end-of-life processes."
