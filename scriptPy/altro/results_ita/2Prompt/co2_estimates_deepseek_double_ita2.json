    "co2e_kg": 8.5,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2 equivalent emissions per kg (CO2e/kg) are calculated based on the material composition and typical emission factors for each material. Plastic (60%) has an emission factor of approximately 6 kg CO2e/kg, metal (20%) around 8 kg CO2e/kg, electronic components (15%) about 12 kg CO2e/kg, and rubber/silicone (5%) roughly 5 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average of these factors results in an estimated 8.5 kg CO2e/kg for the product. This estimation considers the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly processes typical for electronic devices of this nature."

    "explanation": "The CO2 equivalent per kg (CO2e/kg) is estimated based on common emission factors for the materials listed. Plastic has an emission factor of approximately 3 kg CO2e/kg, Aluminum around 8 kg CO2e/kg, Copper about 4 kg CO2e/kg, Silicon roughly 5 kg CO2e/kg, Gold around 20 kg CO2e/kg, and Other metals approximately 6 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average of these factors, considering the given percentages, results in an estimated 12.5 kg CO2e/kg for the product. This estimation includes material production but excludes manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life phases."

    "co2e_kg": 4.8,
    "explanation": "The CO2 equivalent per kg (CO2e/kg) is estimated based on the material composition and typical emission factors for each material. PU Leather has an estimated emission factor of 5.2 kg CO2e/kg, TPU around 3.5 kg CO2e/kg, and Microfiber approximately 6.0 kg CO2e/kg. Other materials (inks, adhesives, etc.) are estimated at 2.0 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average is calculated as follows: (0.5 * 5.2) + (0.3 * 3.5) + (0.15 * 6.0) + (0.05 * 2.0) = 4.8 kg CO2e/kg."

    "co2e_kg": 3.2,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e/kg is calculated based on the material composition: 85% fabric (Hook and Loop Fastening), 10% plastic (Eye hole and reinforcement parts), and 5% adhesive (Self-adhesive design closure). The fabric is assumed to be polyester, with an emission factor of 3.0 kg CO2e/kg. The plastic is assumed to be polypropylene, with an emission factor of 3.5 kg CO2e/kg. The adhesive is assumed to have an emission factor of 4.0 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average of these factors results in an estimated CO2e/kg of 3.2."

    "explanation": "The CO2 equivalent per kg (CO2e/kg) is estimated based on common emission factors for the materials listed. Rubber has an estimated emission factor of 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, plastic (assumed to be ABS) 3.5 kg CO2e/kg, silicone 5.0 kg CO2e/kg, and metal (assumed to be aluminum) 8.0 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average is calculated as (0.5*2.5 + 0.3*3.5 + 0.15*5.0 + 0.05*8.0) = 3.2 kg CO2e/kg. The product's small size and lightweight nature (0.04 lbs) suggest minimal material usage, but the impact per kg is relatively high due to the inclusion of silicone and metal components."

    "explanation": "The CO2e/kg estimate is based on the weighted average of common emission factors for the materials listed. Nylon rip-stop has an estimated emission factor of 5.5 kg CO2e/kg, fiberglass 6.0 kg CO2e/kg, silver coating 50.0 kg CO2e/kg (due to high energy intensity), metal (assumed aluminum) 8.1 kg CO2e/kg, and other materials 2.0 kg CO2e/kg. The weighted average is calculated as (0.4*5.5 + 0.3*6.0 + 0.1*50.0 + 0.15*8.1 + 0.05*2.0) = 8.2 kg CO2e/kg. The high impact of silver coating is partially offset by the lower-impact materials like nylon and fiberglass."

    "explanation": "The CO2e/kg estimate is based on the weighted average of the material composition and typical emission factors for each material. PVC (50%) has an emission factor of ~2.5 kg CO2e/kg, copper (30%) ~4 kg CO2e/kg, gold (1%) ~15 kg CO2e/kg (due to high refining impact), aluminum (5%) ~8 kg CO2e/kg, polyester (10%) ~5 kg CO2e/kg, and other materials (4%) ~3 kg CO2e/kg. The calculation accounts for the cable's lightweight (7 oz â‰ˆ 0.2 kg) and assumes manufacturing/transport adds ~10% to the material footprint."
