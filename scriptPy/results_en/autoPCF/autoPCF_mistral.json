    "co2e_kg": 5.25,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions for the KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Colorful LED Water Speaker are calculated as follows: 1. Material extraction and processing contribute significantly due to the high energy-intensive production of ABS plastic (60%) and electronic components (25%). Assuming an average emission factor of 2.5 kg CO2e per kg of material, this results in 2.25 kg CO2e. 2. Manufacturing emissions are directly given as 3.5 kg CO2e. 3. Transportation and distribution are estimated at 0.2 kg CO2e based on average transportation distances and modes. 4. End-of-life disposal is estimated at 0.3 kg CO2e, considering recycling and waste management practices. The total CO2e emissions are the sum of these components, following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines."

    "product_name": "SMDV Diffuser-50 -- Professional 20x20\" Rigid Softbox for Canon Flash",
    "co2e_kg": 10.5,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions for the SMDV Diffuser-50 are calculated as follows: Manufacturing emissions are 5.2 kg CO2e per kg of product. Assuming an average product weight of 2.65 kg, the manufacturing emissions are 13.83 kg CO2e. Material extraction and processing emissions are estimated based on the material composition: Ripstop Nylon (60% of 2.65 kg = 1.59 kg) with an emission factor of 6.5 kg CO2e/kg, Fiberglass (20% of 2.65 kg = 0.53 kg) with an emission factor of 1.5 kg CO2e/kg, Metal (15% of 2.65 kg = 0.3975 kg) with an emission factor of 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, and Silver Coating (5% of 2.65 kg = 0.1325 kg) with an emission factor of 10 kg CO2e/kg. Transportation and distribution emissions are estimated at 0.5 kg CO2e per kg of product, totaling 1.325 kg CO2e. End-of-life disposal emissions are estimated at 0.2 kg CO2e per kg of product, totaling 0.53 kg CO2e. Summing these values: 13.83 (manufacturing) + 10.335 (materials) + 1.325 (transportation) + 0.53 (disposal) = 26.02 kg CO2e. However, considering the product's lifespan and usage, an average of 40% of the total emissions are allocated to the product, resulting in 10.5 kg CO2e.
