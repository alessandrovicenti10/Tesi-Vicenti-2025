    "co2e_kg": 18.65,
    "explanation": "Following GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044, I calculated the carbon footprint across the full life cycle. Starting with manufacturing emissions (12.8 kgCO2e) from the provided data, I added transportation emissions (2.1 kgCO2e) based on standard shipping assumptions for photography equipment (1.75 kgCO2e/kg × 1.2kg). For use phase, I allocated minimal impact (0.25 kgCO2e) as it's a passive accessory with no direct energy consumption. End-of-life emissions (3.5 kgCO2e) were calculated using material-specific disposal factors: nylon (4.2 kgCO2e/kg × 0.72kg), fiberglass (2.1 kgCO2e/kg × 0.24kg), aluminum (0.5 kgCO2e/kg × 0.12kg), plastics (3.8 kgCO2e/kg × 0.096kg), and silver coating (12 kgCO2e/kg × 0.024kg).
