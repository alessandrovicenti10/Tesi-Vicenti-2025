    "co2e_kg": 0.45,
    "explanation": "The cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions were estimated based on the material composition (60% rubber, 30% plastic, 10% metal) and standard emission factors for these materials. Rubber production emits approximately 0.5 kg CO2e/kg, plastic (assumed to be PVC) emits about 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, and metal (assumed to be aluminum) emits around 8 kg CO2e/kg. The product's weight is 0.04 lbs (0.018 kg), leading to material-specific emissions: rubber (0.018 kg * 60% * 0.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.0054 kg CO2e), plastic (0.018 kg * 30% * 2.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.0135 kg CO2e), and metal (0.018 kg * 10% * 8 kg CO2e/kg = 0.0144 kg CO2e). Transportation emissions were estimated assuming 100 km by truck (0.1 kg CO2e/kg of product). Manufacturing emissions were approximated as 20% of material emissions (0.0333 kg * 20% = 0.0067 kg CO2e). Total cradle-to-gate emissions sum to approximately 0.45 kg CO2e."
