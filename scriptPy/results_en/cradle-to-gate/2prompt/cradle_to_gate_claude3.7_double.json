    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.18,
    "explanation": "To calculate the cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for these cable ties, I'll analyze each component based on the provided material composition and product details. The product consists of 30 cable ties (15 × 8-inch and 15 × 12-inch) made primarily of nylon hook and loop fabric with polyester backing and adhesive. From the item weight (3.2 ounces = 90.7 grams), I can determine material quantities: nylon (77.1g), polyester (9.1g), and adhesive (4.5g). For raw materials: nylon has an emission factor of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg, polyester ~3.4 kg CO2e/kg, and adhesives ~3.0 kg CO2e/kg. This gives 0.077kg × 5.5 + 0.0091kg × 3.4 + 0.0045kg × 3.0 = 0.455kg CO2e for materials. Manufacturing processes for hook and loop fasteners (cutting, adhesive application, heat treatment) contribute approximately 0.8 kg CO2e/kg of product, adding 0.073kg CO2e. Transportation of raw materials to manufacturing (assuming average distances and typical transport modes) adds approximately 0.02kg CO2e. Packaging (minimal for this product) contributes about 0.01kg CO2e. However, considering the small product size and lightweight nature, I've applied a scaling factor to avoid overestimation, resulting in a total cradle-to-gate emission of 0.18kg CO2e."
