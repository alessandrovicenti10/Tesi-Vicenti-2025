    "explanation": "Cradle-to-gate emissions calculated as follows: 1. **Materials**: 65% plastics (0.325 kg) at ~4 kg CO2e/kg = 1.3 kg. Metals (25%, 0.125 kg total) include aluminum (high impact), steel, copper, and neodymium (magnets), totaling ~0.91 kg. Rubber (5%), glass (3%), and 'other' (2%, incl. battery components) add ~0.13 kg. Total materials: ~2.34 kg. 2. **Transport**: 500 km trucking for 0.5 kg materials ≈ 0.025 kg. 3. **Manufacturing**: Energy-intensive processes (e.g., injection molding, PCB assembly) in a coal-heavy grid (China) estimated at ~2 kg. Total: 2.34 + 0.025 + 2 ≈ 4.4 kg, rounded to 4.5 kg to account for uncertainties in battery components and manufacturing energy."
