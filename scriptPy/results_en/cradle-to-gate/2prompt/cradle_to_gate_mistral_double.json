Total: 1.11 kg * 0.1 kg CO2e/km * 500 km = 55.5 kg CO2e. However, this is an overestimation for the raw materials alone, so we'll use a more reasonable 10% of this value: 5.55 kg CO2e.\n\n3. **Manufacturing and Assembly Processes**: Assuming an emission factor of 1 kg CO2e/kg for manufacturing processes. Total: 1.11 kg * 1 kg CO2e/kg = 1.11 kg CO2e.\n\nSumming up all the phases:\n   - Raw Material Extraction and Processing: 1.39 + 1.39 + 0.50 + 0.33 + 0.02 + 0.01 = 3.64 kg CO2e\n   - Transportation: 5.55 kg CO2e\n   - Manufacturing and Assembly: 1.11 kg CO2e\n\nTotal CO2e emissions: 3.64 + 5.55 + 1.11 = 10.3 kg CO2e\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the total cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions are approximately 10.5 kg."
