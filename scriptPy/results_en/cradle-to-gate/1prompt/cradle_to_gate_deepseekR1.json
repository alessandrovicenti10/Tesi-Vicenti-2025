    "co2e_kg": 350,
    "explanation": "Cradle-to-gate emissions are estimated at 350 kg CO2e, primarily from: 1) Raw material extraction/processing (120 kg) including silicon for the GPU, GDDR5 memory, and PCB metals; 2) Manufacturing/assembly (230 kg) due to energy-intensive semiconductor fabrication (lithography, etching) and component assembly; 3) Transportation (<1 kg) of materials via sea/road, minimized by low weight (2.16 lbs). Emissions exclude distribution, use, and disposal phases. Values reflect older 2010 manufacturing processes and conservative material impact assumptions."
