    "product_name": "KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Colorful LED Water Speaker with Dancing Fountain Light Show Sound for PC, MP3 Player, Laptops, Smartphone Black",
    "co2e_kg": 12.5,
    "explanation": "The cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Water Speaker are estimated at 12.5 kg. This calculation includes: 1) Raw material extraction and processing (5 kg CO2e), primarily from plastics (ABS, PC) for the housing, electronics (PCB, LEDs, Bluetooth module), and small metal components. 2) Transportation of raw materials (2 kg CO2e), assuming average distances from suppliers in China to the manufacturing facility via truck. 3) Manufacturing and assembly (5.5 kg CO2e), accounting for injection molding, PCB assembly, and final product assembly. The emissions are based on typical values for small electronic devices of similar weight (0.5 kg) and complexity, with adjustments for the water fountain mechanism and LED light show components. Country of origin (China) and manufacturing energy mix were factored into the calculation."

    "co2e_kg": 2.5,
    "explanation": "The cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the iPad Pro case are estimated at 2.5 kg, based on the following assumptions: 1) Raw material extraction and processing (1.2 kg CO2e): The case is made of PU leather (polyurethane) and TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), both derived from fossil fuels, with energy-intensive production processes. Microfiber lining adds minor emissions. 2) Transportation (0.3 kg CO2e): Assuming raw materials are transported by truck (~500 km) and sea (~2000 km) from Asian suppliers to a Chinese manufacturing facility. 3) Manufacturing (1.0 kg CO2e): Injection molding for TPU components, cutting/sewing for PU leather, and assembly processes, with electricity primarily from coal-powered grids in China. The weight (1.19 lbs/0.54 kg) and hybrid shell design suggest moderate material use. No primary LCA data was available for this specific product, so values are approximated using industry averages for similar electronics accessories."

The SSD and touchscreen display increase emissions slightly compared to non-touch HDD models. Renewed status implies reused components, but this analysis assumes virgin materials for consistency with cradle-to-gate boundaries."

    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.45,
    "explanation": "The cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the Ceeyali reusable hook and loop fastening cable ties were calculated as follows: 1. Raw material extraction and processing: The product is made of fabric material (likely polyester or nylon), with an estimated emission factor of 5 kg CO2e/kg of material. Assuming a total weight of 3.2 ounces (0.09 kg), this phase contributes ~0.45 kg CO2e. 2. Transportation: Given the lightweight nature and likely regional sourcing, transportation emissions are negligible (<0.01 kg CO2e). 3. Manufacturing: The assembly process for hook-and-loop fasteners is low-energy, contributing ~0.01 kg CO2e. The total is dominated by material production. Plastic components (if any) were not included due to conflicting data in product details."

    "product_name": "HYS 3.5mm Police Listen Only Acoustic Tube Earpiece with One Pair Medium Earmolds for Speaker Mics",
    "co2e_kg": 0.45,
    "explanation": "The cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the HYS 3.5mm Police Listen Only Acoustic Tube Earpiece were calculated as follows: 1) Raw material extraction and processing (0.2 kg CO2e): The product is primarily made of rubber (silicone) and small electronic components, with rubber production being the most emissions-intensive. 2) Transportation of raw materials (0.1 kg CO2e): Assuming materials are sourced locally in China and transported by truck over short distances. 3) Manufacturing and assembly (0.15 kg CO2e): The energy-intensive processes include injection molding for the rubber components and assembly of electronic parts. The low weight (0.04 lbs) and simple design help keep emissions relatively low. All values are estimates based on similar small electronic/rubber products and typical manufacturing processes in China."
