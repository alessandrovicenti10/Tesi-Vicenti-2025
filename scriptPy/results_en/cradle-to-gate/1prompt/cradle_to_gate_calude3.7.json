    "product_name": "KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Colorful LED Water Speaker with Dancing Fountain Light Show Sound for PC, MP3 Player, Laptops, Smartphone Black",
    "co2e_kg": 12.8,
    "explanation": "To calculate the cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, I'll analyze each phase systematically. The product is a small electronic device (1.11 pounds/0.5 kg) manufactured in China with LED lights, Bluetooth connectivity, and water fountain features. Based on the product details, I'll estimate emissions for each phase: 1) Raw Materials: The speaker contains plastic housing (~0.25 kg, 2.5 kg CO2e), electronic components including circuit boards, Bluetooth module, and LED lights (~0.15 kg, 4.5 kg CO2e), speaker drivers (~0.05 kg, 1.0 kg CO2e), and a small water pump system (~0.05 kg, 0.8 kg CO2e). 2) Transportation of raw materials: Components are likely sourced within Asia, primarily China, with an estimated 1.2 kg CO2e for transportation to the manufacturing facility. 3) Manufacturing and assembly: Energy consumption for plastic molding, circuit board assembly, testing, and quality control in a Chinese factory, estimated at 2.3 kg CO2e. 4) Packaging: Simple retail packaging with plastic and cardboard, approximately 0.5 kg CO2e. The total cradle-to-gate emissions are therefore approximately 12.8 kg CO2e. This estimate accounts for the electronic nature of the product, its relatively small size, and manufacturing location in China where the electricity grid has a higher carbon intensity than global averages."

    "co2e_kg": 58.7,
    "explanation": "To calculate the cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for the ATI Radeon HD5870 graphics card, I'll analyze each phase systematically:\n\n1. Raw Materials (35.2 kg CO2e):\n   - PCB substrate: ~0.3 kg, primarily fiberglass and epoxy resin (~5.2 kg CO2e)\n   - GPU die: AMD 40nm process chip, silicon wafer processing (~8.5 kg CO2e)\n   - GDDR5 Memory: 2GB of specialized memory chips (~9.8 kg CO2e)\n   - Capacitors, resistors, and other electronic components (~3.2 kg CO2e)\n   - Copper for traces and connections (~2.1 kg CO2e)\n   - Aluminum heat sink and cooling assembly (~4.8 kg CO2e)\n   - Display connectors: 6 DisplayPorts (~1.6 kg CO2e)\n\n2. Transportation of Raw Materials (5.3 kg CO2e):\n   - Semiconductor components typically manufactured in East Asia\n   - PCB materials and assembly components from various global sources\n   - Average transportation distance estimated at 8,000 km\n   - Mix of sea freight (80%) and air freight (20%) for critical components\n   - Based on product weight (2.16 pounds = ~0.98 kg)\n\n3.

    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.42,
    "explanation": "To calculate the cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions for these cable ties, I'll analyze each phase systematically. The product consists of 30 fabric-based hook and loop fastening cable ties (15 at 8 inches, 15 at 12-13 inches). Based on the product details, the total weight is approximately 3.2 ounces (90.7 grams). The material is listed as 'Plastic' in the details, but described as 'fabric material' with hook and loop fastening (similar to Velcro). This is likely a nylon-based product with polyester backing. 1) Raw material extraction and processing: Nylon production has a carbon footprint of approximately 5.5 kg CO2e/kg, and polyester about 3.3 kg CO2e/kg. Assuming a 70/30 mix for hook and loop fasteners, the weighted average is 4.84 kg CO2e/kg. For 90.7g of material, this equals 0.439 kg CO2e. 2) Transportation of raw materials: Assuming manufacturing in Asia with raw materials sourced regionally (500km average transport), using truck transport (0.1 kg CO2e/tonne-km), this adds approximately 0.005 kg CO2e. 3) Manufacturing and assembly: The manufacturing process involves extrusion of synthetic fibers, weaving, and cutting. Energy consumption for this type of light textile processing is approximately 2.5 kWh/kg. Using an average grid emission factor of 0.5 kg CO2e/kWh, this adds 0.113 kg CO2e/kg of product, or 0.01 kg CO2e for this item. 4) Packaging: The product uses minimal packaging (likely plastic film and cardboard), estimated at 10g with an emission factor of 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, adding 0.025 kg CO2e. The total cradle-to-gate emissions are approximately 0.42 kg CO2e, with raw material production being the dominant contributor (about 90% of emissions)."
