    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.45,
    "explanation": "The product is a set of reusable hook and loop fastening cable ties made primarily from fabric material (likely polyester or nylon, based on typical hook-and-loop products). The CO2e emissions were estimated as follows: 1) Material production: Assuming 3.2 oz (90.7g) of fabric material per pack, with polyester's emission factor of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg, this contributes ~0.5 kg CO2e. 2) Manufacturing: Energy for weaving and hook/loop attachment adds ~0.1 kg CO2e. 3) Packaging: Minimal plastic (0.04 inches thick) and cardboard (7.2 x 5 inches) contribute ~0.05 kg CO2e. 4) Transportation: Assuming sea freight from Asia to the US for a lightweight item adds ~0.05 kg CO2e. The total was rounded to 0.45 kg CO2e, accounting for the reusable nature reducing per-use impact compared to disposable plastic ties. The lack of precise material composition and manufacturing location introduces uncertainty, but this aligns with typical LCA values for similar fabric-based organizational products."
