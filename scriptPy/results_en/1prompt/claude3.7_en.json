    "product_name": "KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Colorful LED Water Speaker with Dancing Fountain Light Show Sound for PC, MP3 Player, Laptops, Smartphone Black",
    "co2e_kg": 12.8,
    "explanation": "To calculate the CO2e emissions for the KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, I'll analyze its components, materials, manufacturing, transportation, and use phase. Based on the product details: The speaker weighs 1.11 pounds (0.503 kg) and contains electronic components, plastic housing, LED lights, and water features. Breaking down the emissions: 1) Materials (60% of total): Plastic casing (~40% of weight): 0.201 kg × 3.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.704 kg CO2e. Electronic components (PCB, speakers, Bluetooth module): ~30% of weight: 0.151 kg × 40 kg CO2e/kg = 6.04 kg CO2e. LEDs and water pump system: ~30% of weight: 0.151 kg × 20 kg CO2e/kg = 3.02 kg CO2e. 2) Manufacturing (20% of total): Assembly in China: ~2.0 kg CO2e. 3) Transportation (15% of total): Shipping from China to distribution centers: ~1.5 kg CO2e. 4) Use phase (5% of total): Electricity consumption over 3-year lifespan: ~0.5 kg CO2e. The total CO2e emissions are approximately 12.8 kg. This estimate accounts for the product's electronic complexity, water feature components, and LED lighting system, which have higher emissions factors than simple plastic products."

    "product_name": "Diamond ATI Radeon HD5870 Eyefinity 6 Edition 2048 MB GDDR5 PCI-Express Video Card 5870PE52G",
    "co2e_kg": 86.4,
    "explanation": "To calculate the CO2e emissions for this ATI Radeon HD5870 graphics card, I'll analyze its components and lifecycle. Based on the product details: The card weighs 2.16 pounds (0.98 kg) and contains a 2GB GDDR5 memory. For a typical graphics card of this generation, the material composition is approximately: 40% PCB (printed circuit board), 30% metals (copper, aluminum), 15% silicon chip, 10% plastic components, and 5% other materials. Manufacturing emissions are significant for semiconductor devices. The HD5870 was a high-end card from 2010 with complex manufacturing. For the calculation: PCB production (~0.39 kg): 15 kg CO2e/kg = 5.9 kg CO2e; Metals (~0.29 kg): 8 kg CO2e/kg = 2.3 kg CO2e; Silicon chip and processing (~0.15 kg): 450 kg CO2e/kg = 67.5 kg CO2e; Plastics (~0.10 kg): 3 kg CO2e/kg = 0.3 kg CO2e; Assembly, packaging and distribution: ~10 kg CO2e. The high emissions factor for the silicon chip reflects the energy-intensive semiconductor manufacturing process, including cleanroom operations, chemical processes, and precision manufacturing. The total CO2e emissions are approximately 86.4 kg, which is typical for a high-performance graphics card of this generation. This estimate doesn't include use-phase emissions, which would depend on usage patterns and electricity sources."

    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.42,
    "explanation": "To calculate the CO2e emissions for these cable ties, I'll analyze the materials, manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life phases. From the product description, we have 30 fabric cable ties (15 x 8-inch and 15 x 12-inch). The details mention 'Material: Plastic' but the description specifies 'high quality fabric material' with hook and loop fastening (similar to Velcro). The package weighs 3.2 ounces (90.7g). Breaking this down: 1) Materials: Assuming nylon fabric with hook-and-loop fasteners (80% nylon, 20% polyester), with emission factors of 5.5 kg CO2e/kg for nylon and 2.7 kg CO2e/kg for polyester, materials contribute approximately 0.35 kg CO2e. 2) Manufacturing: Simple cutting and assembly processes add approximately 0.03 kg CO2e. 3) Packaging: Minimal plastic packaging contributes about 0.01 kg CO2e. 4) Transportation: Assuming standard global supply chain with manufacturing in Asia and distribution to North America, this adds approximately 0.02 kg CO2e. 5) End-of-life: Minimal impact for this small product, approximately 0.01 kg CO2e. The total CO2e emissions are therefore approximately 0.42 kg CO2e for the entire package of 30 cable ties. This is relatively low due to the small product size, simple manufacturing process, and lightweight materials."

    "product_name": "HYS 3.5mm Police Listen Only Acoustic Tube Earpiece with One Pair Medium Earmolds for Speaker Mics",
    "co2e_kg": 0.87,
    "explanation": "To calculate the CO2e emissions for this police earpiece, I analyzed the product's materials, weight, manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life disposal. The product weighs 0.04 pounds (0.018 kg) according to the details. Based on the product description and images, I estimated the material composition as: 60% plastic/rubber (silicone earpieces, acoustic tube), 30% electronics (wiring, connector), and 10% packaging. For manufacturing emissions, I used standard emission factors: plastics (3.0 kg CO2e/kg), electronics components (25 kg CO2e/kg), and packaging (2.0 kg CO2e/kg). The product is manufactured in China and shipped globally, adding approximately 0.2 kg CO2e for transportation. The calculation is: (0.018 kg × 60% × 3.0 kg CO2e/kg) + (0.018 kg × 30% × 25 kg CO2e/kg) + (0.018 kg × 10% × 2.0 kg CO2e/kg) + 0.2 kg CO2e (transportation) = 0.0324 + 0.135 + 0.0036 + 0.2 = 0.371 kg CO2e. Adding 0.5 kg CO2e for the product's full lifecycle including retail operations, use phase (minimal for passive earpiece), and end-of-life disposal brings the total to approximately 0.87 kg CO2e."

    "product_name": "SMDV Diffuser-50 -- Professional 20x20\" Rigid Softbox for Canon Flash",
    "co2e_kg": 5.8,
    "explanation": "To calculate the CO2e emissions for this SMDV Diffuser-50 softbox, I analyzed the product's materials and manufacturing based on the provided information. The product weighs 2.65 pounds (1.2 kg) and consists primarily of nylon fabric (both ripstop shell and diffusers), fiberglass rods, and metal components (speed ring and L-bracket). Based on the description, I estimate the material composition as: 60% nylon (0.72 kg), 25% fiberglass (0.3 kg), and 15% metal components (0.18 kg). The emission factors used are: nylon (5.5 kg CO2e/kg), fiberglass (2.6 kg CO2e/kg), and metal hardware (4.5 kg CO2e/kg). This gives us: (0.72 kg × 5.5 kg CO2e/kg) + (0.3 kg × 2.6 kg CO2e/kg) + (0.18 kg × 4.5 kg CO2e/kg) = 3.96 + 0.78 + 0.81 = 5.55 kg CO2e. Adding approximately 0.25 kg CO2e for packaging and transportation brings the total to 5.8 kg CO2e. This estimate accounts for raw material extraction, manufacturing, and distribution, but not use phase or end-of-life as these are negligible for this type of product."

Based on typical weights and materials: The PCB board (~50g) contributes ~3.5 kg CO2e due to semiconductor manufacturing. The microSD card (~2g) adds ~0.5 kg CO2e from flash memory production. The plastic case, cables, and accessories (~200g total) contribute ~1.2 kg CO2e. The power supply (~100g) adds ~2.1 kg CO2e from electronics and copper components. Manufacturing and assembly processes add ~3.5 kg CO2e. Transportation and packaging contribute ~2.0 kg CO2e. The total lifecycle emissions are approximately 12.8 kg CO2e, which is relatively low compared to larger computing devices like laptops (~300 kg CO2e) or desktop computers (~500+ kg CO2e). This estimate accounts for raw material extraction, manufacturing, assembly, and distribution, but excludes use phase emissions which depend on electricity source and usage patterns."
