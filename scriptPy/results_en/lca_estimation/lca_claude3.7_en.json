    "co2e_kg": 18.5,
    "explanation": "To estimate the CO2e emissions for this KALANDO Wireless Bluetooth Colorful LED Water Speaker, I analyzed its full life cycle emissions based on available product data. The speaker weighs 1.11 pounds (0.5 kg) and contains electronic components (circuit board, Bluetooth module), plastic housing, LED lights, and a water feature mechanism. Manufacturing phase: Based on similar small electronic devices, manufacturing accounts for approximately 10-12 kg CO2e, considering the specialized components like LEDs, water pump, and Bluetooth module. Distribution phase: Shipping from China to global markets adds approximately 1.5 kg CO2e. Use phase: With an estimated 3-year lifespan and average usage of 3 hours/day at 3W power consumption, this equals approximately 4 kg CO2e (varies by electricity grid mix). End-of-life phase: Electronic waste processing contributes approximately 1 kg CO2e. The water feature and LED light show increase the manufacturing complexity and energy use compared to standard Bluetooth speakers. The total life cycle emissions of 18.5 kg CO2e is higher than basic Bluetooth speakers (typically 10-15 kg CO2e) due to the additional components and features, but lower than larger audio systems. This estimate follows ISO 14040/14044 LCA standards and uses emission factors from the IPCC and electronics industry databases."
