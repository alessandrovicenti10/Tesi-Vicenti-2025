    "co2e_kg": 8.7,
    "explanation": "Total CO2e emissions were calculated by summing emissions across all life cycle stages, following GHG Protocol Product Standard system boundaries. Manufacturing emissions (5.2 kg CO2e) were provided. Material extraction/processing was estimated at 2.1 kg CO2e (70% plastic at 3 kg CO2e/kg, 10% rubber at 1.5 kg CO2e/kg, 10% metal at 2 kg CO2e/kg, 5% glass at 0.5 kg CO2e/kg, 5% electronics at 1 kg CO2e/kg, scaled to 0.5 kg product weight). Transportation/distribution added 1.2 kg CO2e (assumed 5,000 km by sea at 0.01 kg CO2e/kg-km + 500 km by road at 0.1 kg CO2e/kg-km). End-of-life disposal contributed 0.2 kg CO2e (assumed 50% landfill, 50% recycling for plastics/metals). Emission factors were sourced from Ecoinvent and industry averages, with GWP values from IPCC AR5, per ISO 14044 and PAS 2050 requirements."

    "co2e_kg": 150.25,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions were calculated by summing emissions across all life cycle stages, following GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. Material extraction and processing (Scope 3 upstream) were estimated at ~25 kg CO2e based on material composition (silicon, plastics, metals) and industry-average emission factors. Manufacturing emissions (Scope 1 & 2) were provided as 120 kg CO2e. Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream/downstream) were estimated at ~5 kg CO2e (assuming global logistics by air/sea). End-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) was estimated at ~0.25 kg CO2e (assuming 95% landfill and 5% recycling, based on e-waste rates). All values were converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 GWP factors, per PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067."

    "co2e_kg": 3.5,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions are calculated as follows: 1) Material extraction and processing (Scope 3 upstream) contributes ~0.5 kg CO2e/kg, based on weighted material impacts (PU leather: 0.6 kg, TPU: 0.24 kg, microfiber: 0.23 kg, others: 0.03 kg). 2) Manufacturing emissions (Scope 1 & 2) are 2.8 kg CO2e/kg as provided. 3) Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream & downstream) adds ~0.1 kg CO2e/kg, assuming regional shipping by road. 4) End-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) contributes ~0.1 kg CO2e/kg, assuming landfill for non-recyclable materials (PU/TPU). The sum (0.5 + 2.8 + 0.1 + 0.1) = 3.5 kg CO2e per product (weight: 1.19 lbs â‰ˆ 0.54 kg). Calculations follow GHG Protocol Product Standard for system boundaries, ISO 14044 for inventory analysis, and PAS 2050 for emission factors."

    "co2e_kg": 180.5,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions are calculated by summing emissions across all life cycle stages, following GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. Manufacturing emissions (120 kg CO2e) are provided, covering material extraction, processing, and assembly (Scope 1, 2, and 3 upstream). Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream/downstream) are estimated at 30 kg CO2e, assuming global logistics (air/sea freight) and regional distribution. End-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) is estimated at 30.5 kg CO2e, considering 70% recycling (emission savings) and 30% landfill for materials like metals, plastics, and electronics. Emission factors are sourced from industry averages (PAS 2050) and Ecoinvent database, with GWP values from IPCC AR6. The product's renewed status reduces virgin material use but retains manufacturing impacts."

    "co2e_kg": 6.8,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions were calculated by summing emissions from material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life disposal, following GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. Manufacturing emissions (5.2 kg CO2e) were provided. Material extraction and processing for polyester and nylon were estimated at ~1.0 kg CO2e based on industry averages for textile production. Transportation (assuming regional distribution by truck) added ~0.5 kg CO2e. End-of-life (landfill, as no recycling data was available) contributed ~0.1 kg CO2e. The reusable design reduces per-use impact compared to single-use alternatives, but material production dominates the footprint (PAS 2050). All values converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 GWPs."

    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions are calculated by summing emissions across all life cycle stages, following GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. Manufacturing emissions (0.45 kg CO2e) are provided, based on energy-intensive molding processes for silicone/rubber (60%/30%) and plastic (10%). Material extraction/processing (Scope 3) is estimated at ~0.25 kg CO2e, using industry averages for silicone (2.5 kg CO2e/kg), rubber (3 kg CO2e/kg), and plastic (5 kg CO2e/kg) with a product weight of 0.018 kg. Transportation (Scope 3) is estimated at ~0.1 kg CO2e, assuming air freight from China (emission factor: 0.6 kg CO2e/kg*km for ~8000 km). End-of-life (Scope 3) is ~0.05 kg CO2e, assuming landfill disposal (emission factor: 0.1 kg CO2e/kg for non-recycled rubber/silicone).

Material extraction (Scope 3 upstream) is estimated at 30 kg CO2e, based on material composition and industry averages (e.g., aluminum at ~8-12 kg CO2e/kg, plastics at ~3-5 kg CO2e/kg). Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream/downstream) add 15 kg CO2e, assuming global shipping and regional logistics. End-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) contributes 5 kg CO2e, accounting for recycling (50%) and landfill (50%) scenarios.
