    "co2e_kg": 4.3,
    "explanation": "Total emissions calculated per ISO 14044 and PAS 2050 system boundaries: 1) Materials & manufacturing (4.1 kg CO2e) includes PU leather, TPU, and microfiber production (Scope 3) plus processing (Scope 1-2). 2) Added transport (0.1 kg CO2e) via sea/truck using DEFRA emission factors (0.01 kg CO2e/tkm). 3) End-of-life (0.1 kg CO2e) assumes 90% landfill (0.05 kg CO2e/kg) and 10% incineration (3 kg CO2e/kg). All values converted to CO2e using IPCC AR6 GWPs."

    "co2e_kg": 136.3,
    "explanation": "Total CO2e calculated using provided manufacturing emissions (125 kg, covering material extraction & processing [70-80%] and assembly [20-30%], aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1-3). Added 5% (6.25 kg) for transportation (Scope 3 upstream/downstream) and 5 kg for end-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream), based on industry averages for electronics logistics and recycling. Calculations follow ISO 14044 allocation principles and PAS 2050 requirements for full lifecycle inclusion."

    "co2e_kg": 0.9,
    "explanation": "Total calculated as: Manufacturing (0.8 kg - includes material production & processing per GHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream and Scope 1/2) + Transportation (0.02 kg - sea/land logistics for 0.09 kg product from China to US, using ISO 14044 transport factors) + End-of-Life (0.08 kg - 30% incineration/70% landfill assumption for synthetic textiles per PAS 2050). Manufacturing dominates due to energy-intensive polymer processing. Transport minimal due to lightweight product. EOL varies by disposal method but remains secondary."

    "explanation": "Total emissions include material extraction/processing (Scope 3) and manufacturing (Scopes 1 & 2) as per provided data. Calculations followed ISO 14044 and PAS 2050: Material-specific emission factors (nylon: 5.5 kg CO2e/kg, fiberglass: 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, metal: 15 kg CO2e/kg) were applied to material masses (1.2 kg total product weight). Assembly energy added 15% to material emissions. Transportation, distribution, and end-of-life emissions are excluded due to insufficient data, limiting system boundaries as noted in GHG Protocol Product Standard."

    "co2e_kg": 6.1,
    "explanation": "Calculation includes material extraction/processing (Scope 3) and manufacturing (Scope 1-2) based on provided material percentages and manufacturing CO2e (6.1 kg). Gold plating contributes ~25% of total despite 1% mass. Transportation and end-of-life emissions could not be quantified due to missing data (typical 10-20% additional impact for full LCA per ISO 14044). PAS 2050 material-specific factors were applied for copper (5 kg/kg), PVC (3 kg/kg), aluminum (14 kg/kg), brass (5 kg/kg), and gold (150 kg/kg). System boundaries follow GHG Protocol but remain incomplete without logistics and EOL data."
