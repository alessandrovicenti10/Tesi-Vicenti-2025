    "co2e_kg": 3.07,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emission is estimated based on the provided material composition and common emission factors for each material category. For each material, we multiplied its estimated weight (based on the product's total weight of 1.11 pounds or 0.503 kg and percentage composition) by a representative emission factor. We used approximate emission factors for: Plastic (3 kg CO2e/kg), Electronic Components (20 kg CO2e/kg), Speaker Components (5 kg CO2e/kg), Transparent Plastic/Glass (6 kg CO2e/kg), Metal (5 kg CO2e/kg), Rubber/Silicone (6 kg CO2e/kg), and Adhesives (5 kg CO2e/kg). Water is assumed to have negligible emissions. The calculation is based on material production emissions and does not include manufacturing, transport, use phase, or end-of-life impacts. The estimated total CO2e emission for the product is approximately 3.07 kg."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emission is estimated based on the provided material composition and typical emission factors for each material. The product weight is derived from the 'Item Weight' in the product details (2.16 pounds, converted to approximately 0.98 kg). The mass of each material is calculated using the given percentage composition. We used estimated emission factors for each material based on common LCA data for similar materials:\n\n- Fiberglass and Epoxy Resin (PCB): 5 kg CO2e/kg (estimated for PCB manufacturing)\n- Aluminum (Heatsink): 12 kg CO2e/kg (estimated for primary aluminum production)\n- Silicon (Semiconductor Components): 100 kg CO2e/kg (estimated for semiconductor-grade silicon, reflecting energy-intensive manufacturing)\n- Copper (Wiring, Traces, Connectors): 4.8 kg CO2e/kg (average value for copper production)\n- Plastic (Fan, Connectors, Housings): 2 kg CO2e/kg (average value for general plastics)\n- Steel (Fan components, structural elements): 1.8 kg CO2e/kg (average value for steel production)\n\nThese emission factors are estimations and can vary based on specific manufacturing processes, recycled content, and data sources. The total CO2e emission is calculated by summing the emissions from each material component. This estimation focuses on material production and does not include other life cycle stages such as manufacturing processes beyond material production, transportation, use phase, and end-of-life."

    "co2e_kg": 0.29,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emission estimation for the iPad case is based on the provided material composition and general emission factors for similar materials. The product weight is estimated from the 'Item Weight' in the product details, which is 1.19 pounds or approximately 0.54 kg. The material breakdown and estimated emission factors are as follows:\n\n*   **PU Leather (35%):** Assuming an emission factor of 7.5 kg CO2e/kg (mid-range estimate for synthetic leather/plastics).  Contribution: 0.54 kg * 0.35 * 7.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.14 kg CO2e.\n*   **Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) (40%):** Assuming an emission factor of 4 kg CO2e/kg (mid-range estimate for TPU plastic). Contribution: 0.54 kg * 0.40 * 4 kg CO2e/kg = 0.09 kg CO2e.\n*   **Microfiber (10%):** Assuming an emission factor of 10 kg CO2e/kg (mid-range estimate for synthetic fibers like polyester). Contribution: 0.54 kg * 0.10 * 10 kg CO2e/kg = 0.05 kg CO2e.\n*   **Paperboard/Cardboard (15%):** Assuming an emission factor of 1 kg CO2e/kg (general estimate for cardboard). Contribution: 0.54 kg * 0.15 * 1 kg CO2e/kg = 0.01 kg CO2e.\n\n**Total estimated CO2e emissions:** 0.14 kg + 0.09 kg + 0.05 kg + 0.01 kg = 0.29 kg CO2e.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   These are estimations based on general material categories and average emission factors. Actual emission factors can vary significantly depending on the specific production processes, origin of materials, and manufacturing location.\n*   The estimation only considers the material phase and does not include emissions from manufacturing processes, transportation, distribution, and end-of-life stages. A full LCA would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment.\n*   The emission factors used are indicative and based on common LCA databases and literature for similar materials. More precise data would require specific material sourcing and manufacturing information."

    "co2e_kg": 1.17,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emission for the product is estimated to be 1.17 kg. This is calculated based on the provided material composition and the product's weight. The material composition is assumed to be 95% Polyester/Nylon Fabric and 5% Polyester/Nylon Hook and Loop. We used a conservative emission factor of 12.9 kg CO2e per kg of material, which is a representative value for polyester fabric production, and applied it to both material types for simplicity and due to lack of specific emission factors for blended or hook and loop materials. The product weight is given as 3.2 ounces (approximately 0.09072 kg).  \n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Product Weight:** 0.09072 kg\n2. **Material Breakdown:**\n    - Polyester/Nylon Fabric (95%): 0.09072 kg * 0.95 = 0.086184 kg\n    - Polyester/Nylon Hook and Loop (5%): 0.09072 kg * 0.05 = 0.004536 kg\n3. **Emission Factor:** 12.9 kg CO2e/kg (conservative estimate for polyester fabric)\n4. **CO2e Emission Calculation:**\n    - Polyester/Nylon Fabric: 0.086184 kg * 12.9 kg CO2e/kg = 1.1117736 kg CO2e\n    - Polyester/Nylon Hook and Loop: 0.004536 kg * 12.9 kg CO2e/kg = 0.0584144 kg CO2e\n5. **Total CO2e Emission:** 1.1117736 kg CO2e + 0.0584144 kg CO2e = 1.170188 kg CO2e\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the estimated total CO2e emission is 1.17 kg. This is a simplified estimation based on general emission factors and may not account for specific manufacturing processes, transportation, or end-of-life stages."
