    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.32,
    "explanation": "To estimate the CO2e emissions, I analyzed the product which consists of 30 cable ties (15 x 8-inch and 15 x 12-inch) made primarily of nylon hook and loop fastener (85%), polyester fabric (10%), and adhesive (5%).
