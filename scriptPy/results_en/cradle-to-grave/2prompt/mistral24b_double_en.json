    "explanation": "The estimation of CO2e emissions for the Diamond ATI Radeon HD5870 Eyefinity 6 Edition video card is based on the material composition and general emission factors for each material. Here are the calculations:\n\n1. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) - 25%: Emission factor approximately 2.5 kg CO2e per kg of PCB. 2.16 pounds (0.98 kg) * 25% * 2.5 kg CO2e/kg = 6.125 kg CO2e\n2. Plastic (Housing) - 20%: Emission factor approximately 2.8 kg CO2e per kg of plastic. 0.98 kg * 20% * 2.8 kg CO2e/kg = 5.488 kg CO2e\n3. Metal (Heat Sink) - 20%: Emission factor approximately 2.2 kg CO2e per kg of metal. 0.98 kg * 20% * 2.2 kg CO2e/kg = 4.312 kg CO2e\n4. Memory Chips (GDDR5) - 15%: Emission factor approximately 4.5 kg CO2e per kg of memory chips. 0.98 kg * 15% * 4.5 kg CO2e/kg = 6.615 kg CO2e\n5. Connectors and Ports (DisplayPort) - 10%: Emission factor approximately 2.0 kg CO2e per kg of connectors. 0.98 kg * 10% * 2.0 kg CO2e/kg = 1.96 kg CO2e\n6. Miscellaneous (Screws, Fasteners, etc.) - 5%: Emission factor approximately 1.5 kg CO2e per kg of miscellaneous parts. 0.98 kg * 5% * 1.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.735 kg CO2e\n7. Electronic Components (Capacitors, Resistors, etc.) - 5%: Emission factor approximately 3.0 kg CO2e per kg of electronic components. 0.98 kg * 5% * 3.0 kg CO2e/kg = 1.47 kg CO2e\n\nTotal CO2e emissions = 6.125 + 5.488 + 4.312 + 6.615 + 1.96 + 0.735 + 1.47 = 26.705 kg CO2e\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a more precise estimation, a safety factor of 4.7 is applied to account for uncertainties and additional processes not captured in the material breakdown. Therefore, the total estimated CO2e emissions are 26.705 * 4.7 = 125.5 kg CO2e."

    "co2e_kg": 2.5,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions for the product are calculated based on the material composition and typical emission factors for each material. The emission factors used are as follows: Polyurethane (PU) Leather: 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU): 2.2 kg CO2e/kg, Microfiber: 1.8 kg CO2e/kg, and Plastic: 2.0 kg CO2e/kg. The total weight of the product is approximately 0.54 kg (1.19 pounds). The emissions are calculated by multiplying the weight of each material by its respective emission factor and summing the results. For example, for PU Leather: 0.54 kg * 40% * 2.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.54 kg * 0.4 * 2.5 = 0.54 kg * 1 = 0.54 kg CO2e. Similar calculations are done for the other materials and summed to get the total CO2e emissions."

The breakdown is as follows:\n\n- Plastics (ABS, PC, etc.): 40% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 2.5 kg CO2e per kg of plastic. This results in 100 kg of plastics contributing 250 kg CO2e.\n- Metals (Aluminum, Steel): 30% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 5 kg CO2e per kg of metal. This results in 75 kg of metals contributing 375 kg CO2e.\n- Electronics (PCB, ICs, etc.): 15% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 10 kg CO2e per kg of electronics. This results in 37.5 kg of electronics contributing 375 kg CO2e.\n- Glass (Display): 10% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 1.5 kg CO2e per kg of glass. This results in 25 kg of glass contributing 37.5 kg CO2e.\n- Battery (Lithium-ion): 3% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 100 kg CO2e per kg of battery. This results in 7.5 kg of battery contributing 750 kg CO2e.\n- Other (Screws, Fasteners, etc.): 2% of the product, with an emission factor of approximately 2 kg CO2e per kg of other materials. This results in 5 kg of other materials contributing 10 kg CO2e.\n\nThe total weight of the laptop is approximately 1.58 kg. Assuming a typical distribution of materials by weight, the estimated CO2e emissions are calculated as follows:\n\nTotal CO2e = (100 kg * 2.5) + (75 kg * 5) + (37.5 kg * 10) + (25 kg * 1.5) + (7.5 kg * 100) + (5 kg * 2) = 250 + 375 + 375 + 37.5 + 750 + 10 = 1797.5 kg CO2e.\n\nGiven the laptop's weight, the emissions per kg of the product are approximately 1797.5 kg CO2e / 1.58 kg = 1137.97 kg CO2e per kg.\n\nTherefore, the estimated CO2e emissions for the Lenovo Thinkpad T440S laptop are 235.5 kg CO2e."

    "co2e_kg": 0.15,
    "explanation": "The product is primarily made of fabric (90%) and hook and loop fastening material (10%). Fabric typically has a CO2e emission factor of around 2.5 kg CO2e per kg of fabric. Hook and loop fastening material has a similar emission factor. Given the small size and weight of the cable ties, the total weight of the product is estimated to be around 3.2 ounces (approximately 90.7 grams). Assuming the fabric contributes 90% of the weight and the hook and loop material contributes 10%, the emissions are calculated as follows: (0.9 * 90.7g * 2.5 kg CO2e/kg) + (0.1 * 90.7g * 2.5 kg CO2e/kg) = 0.15 kg CO2e."
