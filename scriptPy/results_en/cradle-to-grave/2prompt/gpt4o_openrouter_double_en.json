    "co2e_kg": 0.72,
    "explanation": "The product is primarily composed of Nylon (85%), Polyester (10%), and Adhesive (5%). Using common emission factors for these materials, the CO2e emissions are estimated as follows: Nylon has an emission factor of approximately 5.4 kg CO2e per kg, Polyester has an emission factor of approximately 3.0 kg CO2e per kg, and Adhesive (synthetic resin) has an emission factor of approximately 2.0 kg CO2e per kg. The total weight of the product is 3.2 ounces (0.09 kg). Breaking this down by material composition, the CO2e emissions are calculated as: (0.09 * 0.85 * 5.4) + (0.09 * 0.10 * 3.0) + (0.09 * 0.05 * 2.0) = 0.72 kg CO2e. This estimate assumes standard emission factors and does not account for specific manufacturing or transportation impacts."
