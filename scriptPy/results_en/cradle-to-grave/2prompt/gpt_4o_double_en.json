    "product_name": "Ceeyali Reusable Hook and Loop Fastening Cable Ties Cable Straps for Home Office Tablet PC TV Electronics Wires Organizer Management (15 Pack 8 inch + 15 Pack 12 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The product is composed of 70% Nylon, 20% Polyester, and 10% Adhesive. Nylon production typically emits around 5.43 kg CO2e per kg, Polyester around 3.2 kg CO2e per kg, and Adhesives can vary but are estimated at around 2 kg CO2e per kg. The total weight of the product is 3.2 ounces (approximately 0.09 kg). Calculating the emissions: (0.09 kg * 0.7 * 5.43) + (0.09 kg * 0.2 * 3.2) + (0.09 kg * 0.1 * 2) = 0.34 + 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.42 kg CO2e. Rounding up for potential variations in adhesive emissions, the total estimated CO2e emissions are approximately 0.5 kg."
