    "co2e_kg": 0.45,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions are based on the material composition provided (80% fabric, 15% plastic, 5% adhesive) and common emission factors for these materials. Fabric (Hook and Loop Fastening) has an approximate emission factor of 5 kg CO2e/kg, plastic (reinforcement/closure) around 3 kg CO2e/kg, and adhesive (backing/closure) around 4 kg CO2e/kg. The total weight of the product is 3.2 ounces (0.09 kg). The calculation assumes a weighted average of these materials and their respective emission factors, resulting in an estimated total of 0.45 kg CO2e for the product."

    "co2e_kg": 350,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions are based on the material composition and typical emission factors for each material. The laptop's main components include aluminum (30%), plastic (25%), glass (10%), copper (8%), steel (7%), silicon (6%), lithium (5%), other metals (4%), rubber/elastomers (3%), and ceramics (2%). The production of these materials, especially aluminum and plastics, contributes significantly to the total emissions. Additionally, the manufacturing process, assembly, and transportation of the laptop add to the overall carbon footprint. The estimated value of 350 kg CO2e is a rough approximation considering the average emissions for similar laptops in the market."
