    "explanation": "The cradle-to-grave carbon footprint for the iPhone 16 128GB is estimated at 66 kg CO₂e. As of June 2024, Apple has not yet published an official Product Environmental Report for the iPhone 16. Therefore, this value is estimated based on Apple's most recent official disclosures for the iPhone 15 128GB, which reports a total lifecycle footprint of 66 kg CO₂e (source: Apple Environmental Progress Report 2023). The estimate assumes similar materials, manufacturing processes, logistics, use-phase energy (EU grid mix, 4 years), and end-of-life treatment as the iPhone 15. If Apple releases an official figure for the iPhone 16, this estimate should be updated accordingly. No significant design or process changes are publicly known that would materially affect the carbon footprint compared to the previous generation."
