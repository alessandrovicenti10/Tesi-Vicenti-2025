    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions were calculated following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. The system boundaries included material extraction/processing, manufacturing/assembly, transportation, and end-of-life stages (cradle-to-grave, excluding the use phase based on prompt scope). The provided manufacturing CO2e (50 kg) was taken to encompass material extraction, processing, component manufacturing, and final assembly (Scope 1, 2, & 3 upstream), as detailed in its explanation and consistent with typical smartphone LCA reporting structures. Transportation emissions (Scope 3 upstream/downstream) were estimated at 3 kg CO2e, and End-of-Life processing (Scope 3 downstream) was estimated at 1 kg CO2e, based on typical contributions seen in comparable product LCAs (e.g., Apple Environmental Reports) due to the absence of specific data for these stages. The total CO2e is the sum of these stages (50 + 3 + 1 = 54 kg). Assumptions regarding transportation and EoL were necessary, and the final value depends heavily on specific supply chain characteristics (energy sources, transport modes, recycling infrastructure)."

    "co2e_kg": 55.0,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions were calculated following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. System Boundaries included Material Extraction & Processing, Manufacturing, Transportation & Distribution, and End-of-Life Disposal, excluding the Use Phase as per the defined scope. \n1. Material Extraction & Manufacturing: The provided data indicates 50.00 kg CO2e for these combined stages (Scope 1, 2, and 3 upstream), covering raw material extraction/processing, component production, and final assembly, consistent with ISO 14044 life cycle inventory aggregation.\n2. Transportation & Distribution (Scope 3 upstream/downstream): Estimated based on typical global logistics for smartphones (approx. 0.325 kg shipping weight including minimal packaging). Assumed mix of air and ground freight resulted in an estimated 4.00 kg CO2e.\n3. End-of-Life Disposal (Scope 3 downstream): Estimated based on common e-waste scenarios (mix of recycling, landfill, incineration) considering collection, transport, and processing/disposal emissions. A conservative estimate of 1.00 kg CO2e was used, acknowledging variability based on regional practices and allocation methods (as per PAS 2050 / ISO 14067).\nTotal CO2e = Manufacturing/Materials (50.00 kg) + Transportation (4.00 kg) + End-of-Life (1.00 kg) = 55.00 kg CO2e. All GHG emissions are expressed as CO2 equivalents (CO2e) using standard GWP values."

    "product_name": "iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) - 256GB",
    "co2e_kg": 66.0,
    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions are calculated based on the provided data, specifically referencing Apple's Product Environmental Report findings for the iPad Pro 11-inch (M4, 256GB). The manufacturing phase contributes 53.5 kg CO2e, stated to be 81% of the total lifecycle emissions. Therefore, the total lifecycle CO2e is calculated as 53.5 kg / 0.81 = 66.049 kg, rounded to 66.00 kg CO2e. This figure encompasses the required system boundaries (material extraction/processing, manufacturing, transportation, end-of-life) as defined by the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. The calculation adheres to PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 principles by summing CO2e across the product lifecycle, assuming the underlying Apple report follows these standards, incorporating material inputs, energy use, and associated emissions converted to CO2e using appropriate GWP values."
