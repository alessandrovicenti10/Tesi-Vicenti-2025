This estimate is based on the official Apple Product Environmental Report for the closest comparable model, the iPhone 15 128GB (released September 12, 2023), which reported a total life cycle (cradle-to-grave) emission of 61 kg CO2e. Assumptions include: similar materials composition (aluminum, glass, rare earths, etc.), manufacturing complexity (including semiconductor fabrication and assembly), transportation logistics, user energy consumption patterns over a 3-year lifespan, and end-of-life recycling processes. The breakdown for the iPhone 15 128GB was approximately: Production 77% (47 kg), Transportation 7% (4 kg), Use 15% (9 kg), End-of-Life <1% (1 kg). It is assumed the iPhone 16 128GB will have a similar environmental footprint, pending official data release post-launch.

The estimation uses the official lifecycle CO2e emissions data for the closest comparable product, the Apple iPhone 15 (128GB), as a proxy. Apple's Product Environmental Report for the iPhone 15 (128GB), released September 12, 2023, states a total lifecycle greenhouse gas emission of 61 kg CO2e.\nAssumptions: \n1. The 'iPhone 16e 128GB' is assumed to have a similar size, weight, material composition (including recycled content levels), manufacturing complexity, and energy efficiency during use as the iPhone 15 (128GB).\n2. Apple's LCA methodology, which includes production (material extraction, manufacturing, assembly), distribution (transport), customer use (based on modeled energy consumption over a typical lifespan), and end-of-life processing (recycling), is considered representative for this future model.\n3. The 'e' suffix does not signify a drastic change in design or materials that would substantially alter the carbon footprint compared to the standard iPhone 15 model.\nWhile Apple continuously works on reducing emissions, using the most recent available data for a similar model provides the best current estimate until official figures for the iPhone 16e are published."

    "co2e_kg": 72,
    "explanation": "No official manufacturer carbon footprint report or EPD exists for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as the product has not been officially announced or released by Samsung at this time. This value is an estimation based on the official Product Environmental Report for the most recent comparable flagship model, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (256GB model, SM-S928B/DS, report dated January 2024). Samsung reported a cradle-to-grave Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 72 kg CO2e for the S24 Ultra. This estimation assumes that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a similar size, weight, material composition (including recycled materials, glass, metal frame), manufacturing complexity, distribution network, use phase energy consumption profile (based on a typical 2-year lifetime), and end-of-life scenario as its predecessor. The estimation methodology aligns with LCA standards (ISO 14040/14044) and carbon footprinting guidelines (GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14067). The primary source for the estimated value is the S24 Ultra's official report, used as a proxy due to the unavailability of S25 Ultra specific data."
