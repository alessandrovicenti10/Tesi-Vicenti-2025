    "explanation": "Estimation based on predecessor model. As of the current date, the iPhone 16 has not been released, and therefore no official manufacturer environmental report or EPD is available. This estimate is based on the official lifecycle CO2e value for the most recent comparable model, the iPhone 15 128GB, as published by Apple in its Product Environmental Report (dated September 12, 2023). The report states a total lifecycle greenhouse gas emission of 61 kg CO2e for the iPhone 15 128GB configuration. This value covers production (materials, manufacturing, packaging), transportation, customer use (based on a 3-year estimated period), and end-of-life processing. It is assumed that the iPhone 16 128GB will have a similar footprint due to comparable size, materials, manufacturing complexity, and Apple's ongoing environmental initiatives, although the actual value may differ once official data is released. This estimation approach uses the best available data from a highly similar product, aligning with LCA principles (ISO 14040/14044) and product carbon footprint standards (GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14067) by leveraging manufacturer data for a proxy product."

While the TIO Flex 24i is also listed, it functions as a modular base often paired with displays like the T24i-30; this official PCF for the T24i-30/P24i-30 is the most relevant manufacturer data available for the listed product group."

    "product_name": "ThinkPad P1 Gen 5",
    "co2e_kg": 397,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emission value is based on the official Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) report published by the manufacturer, Lenovo, for the ThinkPad P1 Gen 5 (Type 21DC, representative configuration). The report, dated June 13, 2022, calculates the cradle-to-grave emissions using LCA methodology (aligned with GHG Protocol, ISO 14040/44, ISO 14067) and assumes a 4-year product lifespan. The reported value for the specified configuration (Intel Core i7-12800H, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX A2000, WQUXGA display, 90Wh battery) is 397 kg CO2e. This value encompasses raw material acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, use phase (based on ENERGY STAR methodology and regional grid mix), and end-of-life treatment."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions were obtained from the official manufacturer (Lenovo) Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Information Sheet for the ThinkPad P15v Gen 3 / ThinkPad T15p Gen 3 (Intel) models, dated October 17, 2022. The report states a total lifecycle carbon footprint (cradle-to-grave) of 354 kg CO2e for the representative product configuration. The assessment methodology aligns with ISO 14040/14044 standards and considers material acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, use (assuming 4 years in EU), and end-of-life stages. This value represents the official manufacturer-reported data."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emission value is sourced directly from the official Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) report for the Lenovo ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 AMD (Type 21B9, 21BA), dated 2022-06-21. The report calculates the cradle-to-grave greenhouse gas emissions according to GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard, PAS 2050:2011, and ISO 14067:2018 methodologies, assuming a 4-year lifespan and global usage. The total Global Warming Potential (GWP-GHG) is reported as 194 kg CO2e per unit. Source: Lenovo PCF Datasheet (accessed via Lenovo compliance documentation website)."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emission value is sourced directly from the official Samsung Product Environmental Report for the Galaxy S24 Ultra (model SM-S928B, 256GB version). The report indicates a total life cycle (cradle-to-grave) carbon footprint of 74.0 kg CO2e. This assessment, verified by UL Solutions, considers raw material sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, product use (based on a 3-year lifespan in the EU), and end-of-life treatment, following standards like ISO 14040/14044 and ISO 14067. This value represents the official manufacturer data."

    "co2e_kg": 70.0,
    "explanation": "Data source: Estimation based on manufacturer report for a predecessor model.\n\nAs of the current date, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has not been officially released, and therefore, no specific carbon footprint report from the manufacturer (Samsung) is available for this model.\n\nThis estimate is based on the official 'Product Environmental Report' for the closest predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (256GB model), which Samsung reported as having a cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of 70 kg CO2e. This value typically follows ISO 14040/14044 and GHG Protocol guidelines, covering raw material acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, product use (usually based on 2-3 years lifecycle in a specific region like Europe), and end-of-life treatment.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a similar size, weight, material composition (including an increasing share of recycled materials, following Samsung's trend), manufacturing complexity, and energy efficiency during the use phase compared to the S24 Ultra.\n- Samsung's calculation methodology and system boundaries for the S25 Ultra will remain consistent with those used for the S24 Ultra.\n\nThis figure represents an estimation, and the actual value for the Galaxy S25 Ultra may differ once officially published by Samsung."
