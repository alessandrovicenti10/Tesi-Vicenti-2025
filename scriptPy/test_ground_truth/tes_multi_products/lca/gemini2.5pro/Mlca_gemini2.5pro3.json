    "explanation": "Estimation based on manufacturer data for a similar model. As of the current date, the iPhone 16 has not been released, and therefore no official Product Environmental Report or EPD from Apple is available for the iPhone 16 128GB. This value (61 kg CO2e) is taken directly from the official Apple Product Environmental Report for the most recent comparable model, the iPhone 15 128GB (released September 12, 2023). Apple's reports calculate emissions based on a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology consistent with ISO 14040/14044, covering production (materials extraction, manufacturing, packaging), transportation, customer use (estimated over a 3-year period), and end-of-life treatment. This estimate assumes the iPhone 16 128GB will have a similar environmental footprint to its direct predecessor. The actual emissions for the iPhone 16 may differ based on its specific materials, manufacturing processes, energy efficiency, and design changes.

The CO2e estimate is based on the publicly available Product Environmental Report for a similar, recent model, the iPhone 15 (128GB), which reports 61 kg CO2e over its life cycle. This estimation assumes the 'iPhone 16e' will have a comparable size, material composition, manufacturing process complexity, usage pattern (3 years), and end-of-life treatment. The estimation follows LCA principles (ISO 14040/14044) and considers the cradle-to-grave life cycle stages: production (material extraction, component manufacturing, assembly - typically the largest share, ~78% for iPhone 15), transportation (~5%), use phase (energy consumption - ~16%), and end-of-life processing (~1%). This estimate utilizes Apple's published methodology for their LCA calculations as a baseline."

    "co2e_kg": 175,
    "explanation": "Datasource: Estimation based on manufacturer data for a predecessor model.\n\n1.  **Manufacturer Report Check:** As of the current knowledge cutoff, Apple has not released an official Product Environmental Report (PER) specifically for the 'MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)'.\n2.  **Estimation Methodology:** Lacking official data, the CO2e emissions were estimated based on the official PER for the most recent, comparable predecessor: the '14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 512GB SSD)', released October 2023. This predecessor model reported a lifecycle CO2e footprint of 180 kg CO2e.\n3.  **Assumptions for M4 Model:**\n    *   **Baseline:** The M3 model's footprint (180 kg CO2e) serves as the baseline.\n    *   **System Boundaries:** Follows Apple's standard PER methodology (aligned with ISO 14040/14044), covering Production (materials, manufacturing, assembly), Transport, Use (modeled customer use over several years), and End-of-Life processing.\n    *   **Chip Impact (M4 vs M3):** The M4 chip uses a potentially more advanced manufacturing process (e.g., second-gen 3nm) and offers improved performance-per-watt. While the new chip's manufacturing might have slightly different emissions, the overall product footprint is dominated by other components (enclosure, display, battery). The M4's anticipated higher energy efficiency should reduce use-phase emissions compared to the M3 model (Use phase was 21% or ~38 kg CO2e for the M3 model).\n    *   **Materials & Other Factors:** Assumed that Apple continues its trend of increasing recycled content and improving supply chain/manufacturing efficiency, potentially offsetting any minor increases from chip production changes.\n    *   **Overall Estimate:** Considering the likely decrease in use-phase emissions due to M4's efficiency and potential material/manufacturing improvements, partially offset by the complexity of a new chip generation, the total lifecycle emissions for the M4 model are estimated to be slightly lower than the M3 baseline. A value of 175 kg CO2e is estimated, reflecting a minor improvement.\n4.  **Conclusion:** This value (175 kg CO2e) is an estimation derived from the closest available manufacturer data and reasonable assumptions about the generational changes from M3 to M4. The actual value may differ once an official Apple report is published."

The report states a total life cycle emission (cradle-to-grave) of 388 kg CO2e for the representative product configuration. The calculation methodology used is the PAIA Tool (Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm), version 2021, developed by MIT for the electronics sector, which is stated to be aligned with relevant standards including the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044. The assessment covers manufacturing (materials, components, assembly), distribution, use (assuming 4 years in the EU), and end-of-life phases."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emission value is based on the official manufacturer data provided by Samsung for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Samsung reports a total life cycle carbon footprint (cradle-to-grave) of 71.0 kg CO2e for this model. This assessment was conducted according to the PAS 2050 standard and verified by the Carbon Trust. The value encompasses raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, product use (based on a standard usage pattern over its expected lifespan), and end-of-life treatment.

    "product_name": "Galaxy S25 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 73.0,
    "explanation": "The specified product, 'Galaxy S25 Ultra', has not been released by the manufacturer (Samsung) as of the current date. Therefore, no official carbon footprint report or Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is available for this specific model.\n\nThis value is an estimation based on the official Product Environmental Report for the most recent comparable model, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. According to Samsung's report (available on their website), the Galaxy S24 Ultra (256GB model) has a cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of 73.0 kg CO2e. \n\nThis estimation assumes that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a similar size, material composition, manufacturing complexity, usage pattern, and end-of-life scenario as its predecessor. The S24 Ultra calculation methodology cited by Samsung is based on CML 2001 (GWP 100a), covering pre-manufacturing, manufacturing, distribution, 3 years of use (EU scenario), and end-of-life stages, aligning with principles from ISO 14040/14044 and GHG Protocol standards. \n\nKey contributors typically include manufacturing (materials extraction, component production, assembly) and use phase (electricity consumption), though Samsung's reports often show manufacturing as dominant. Actual emissions for the S25 Ultra may differ based on final specifications, material choices (e.g., recycled content), manufacturing efficiencies, and potential changes in battery or processor technology."
