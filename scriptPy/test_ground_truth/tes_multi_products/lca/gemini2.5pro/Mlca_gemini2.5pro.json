Therefore, this value is an estimation based on the closest available official data. The estimation uses the official lifecycle CO2e emissions reported for the most recent comparable model: the MacBook Air 13-inch with M3 chip (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD). According to Apple's Product Environmental Report for this M3 model (dated February 2024), the total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are 141 kg CO2e. This value encompasses materials extraction, manufacturing, transportation, 4 years of estimated customer use, and end-of-life processing, calculated following ISO 14040/14044 standards. Assumptions for this estimate: The hypothetical M4 model would have a similar size, weight, primary materials composition (including recycled content levels), manufacturing process energy efficiency, usage energy profile, and end-of-life treatment as the M3 model it would succeed.

    "explanation": "The CO2e emission value is based on the official Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Information Sheet provided by the manufacturer, Lenovo, for the specific model 'ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 AMD'. The report (Document version: PA3-0196-00-A, Date: June 13, 2022) calculates a total cradle-to-grave emission of 247 kg CO2e. The assessment methodology follows ISO 14040/14044, ISO 14067, and the GHG Protocol Product Standard. The life cycle stages included are Manufacturing (157 kg CO2e), Transport (10 kg CO2e), Use (72 kg CO2e, assuming 4 years), and End-of-Life (8 kg CO2e).

    "explanation": "Data sourced from the official Samsung 'Environmental Datasheet Galaxy S24 Ultra (SM-S928B)' dated 2024.01.17. This value represents the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint (Global Warming Potential) calculated according to PAS 2050 / ISO 14067 standards and certified by the Carbon Trust. The assessment includes emissions from raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, product use (based on a 2-year lifetime assumption and EU usage patterns), and end-of-life treatment."

    "product_name": "Galaxy S25 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 54,
    "explanation": "Datasource: Estimation. Official manufacturer reports for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are not available as the product has not yet been released (as of mid-2024). The CO2e estimation is based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, and related carbon footprinting standards. \nAssumptions & Methodology:\n1. Baseline: The primary reference point is the official carbon footprint of the predecessor model, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (256GB), reported by Samsung as 56 kg CO2e for its lifecycle (cradle-to-grave).\n2. Lifecycle Stages Considered: Manufacturing (including raw material extraction, processing, component production, assembly), Distribution (transportation), Use (energy consumption over an assumed lifespan, typically 2-3 years), and End-of-Life (disposal/recycling processes).\n3. Trend Analysis: Manufacturers like Samsung generally aim to reduce the environmental impact of successive product generations. This is often achieved through increased use of recycled materials (e.g., aluminum, plastics, rare earths), improved energy efficiency in manufacturing facilities, optimized packaging, and enhanced product energy efficiency. The decrease from the S23 Ultra (63 kg CO2e) to the S24 Ultra (56 kg CO2e) supports this trend.\n4. Estimation Logic: Assuming Samsung continues these incremental improvements for the S25 Ultra, a slight further reduction from the S24 Ultra's footprint is plausible. Potential increases in complexity or features might counteract some gains, but the overall trend suggests stabilization or slight reduction. Therefore, an estimated value of 54 kg CO2e is projected.\n5. Key Contributors: Consistent with typical smartphone LCAs, the manufacturing phase (especially semiconductor fabrication and materials like aluminum/titanium and glass) is expected to be the largest contributor, followed by the use phase, distribution, and end-of-life.\nThis value is an estimate and the actual figure will depend on the final specifications, materials, manufacturing processes, and methodology used by Samsung in their official assessment upon product release."
