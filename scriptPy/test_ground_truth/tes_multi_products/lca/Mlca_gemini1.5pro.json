The following breakdown is an approximation:\n\n* **Materials Production (45%):** This includes the CO2e associated with manufacturing components like the LCD panel, plastics, electronic circuitry, metals, and packaging.  This is a significant portion due to the energy-intensive processes involved in producing these materials. We assume the monitor consists of approximately 10% ferrous metals, 30% plastics, 20% electronic components and 40% LCD display specific materials (such as glass and liquid crystals). Latest emission factors for these materials were used for this calculation.\n* **Manufacturing (20%):** Assembly, testing, and packaging of the monitor contribute to emissions through electricity consumption in the manufacturing facility.  Location of actual manufacturing is not known and an average global value used for electricity emission factors.\n* **Transportation (5%):** Transportation of components and the finished product from manufacturing sites to distribution centers and end-users. Average shipping distances and multimodal transport (sea, air, road) are accounted for in an approximate manner.\n* **Use Phase (25%):**  Dominated by electricity consumption during operation. An average use of 5 years and a typical power consumption for a 24-inch LCD monitor (around 20W) are used. The calculation considers Energy Star rating and power management features, however, individual user behavior greatly influences the actual energy consumption and emission.\n* **End-of-Life (5%):** This accounts for the emissions related to collection, recycling, and disposal.  A recycling rate of 50% is considered based on the average for such products.  The recycled materials offset the production of new materials and the remaining fraction contributes to emissions through landfill or incineration scenarios.\n \nIt is important to note that this estimate represents a midpoint for this specific product. Uncertainties may include actual materials used, manufacturing processes, and product lifespan. It should be regarded as representative within a +/- 20% margin.\n\nSources:\n* Ecoinvent Centre for Life Cycle Inventories database\n* GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard\n*  World Steel Association on Steel LCA"
