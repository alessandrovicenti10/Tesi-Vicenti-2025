    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint reports or environmental product declarations (EPD) from the manufacturer (Lenovo) were found for the ThinkPad P1 Gen 5. Therefore, the CO2e emissions were estimated based on the following method:\n\n1. **Main Materials Composition**: Assumed similar material composition to high-end laptops (aluminum, plastics, circuit boards, batteries).\n2. **Manufacturing Processes**: Used emission factors for electronics manufacturing, including component production and assembly, based on industry averages from sources like ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) and IEA (International Energy Agency).\n3. **Transportation**: Estimated emissions for transporting components and finished products globally using average freight data.\n4. **Use Phase Energy Consumption**: Assumed an average usage scenario (8 hours per day over 5 years) and typical energy consumption for a high-performance laptop (approximately 60W during use, with standby and sleep modes considered). Data from EPA Energy Star program and manufacturers' listed power consumption details were used.\n5. **End-of-Life Disposal**: Included emissions from recycling and disposal processes based on typical e-waste management practices (source: UNEP)."

    "product_name": "ThinkPad P15v Gen 3 Intel / ThinkPad T15p Gen 3 Intel",
    "co2e_kg": 800,
    "explanation": "No official manufacturer carbon footprint report or EPD for the Thinkpad P15v Gen 3 Intel / T15p Gen 3 Intel is available as of this date. The CO2e emissions were therefore estimated using the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. The estimation considers the main materials composition typical of high-end laptops (aluminum, plastics, copper), energy-intensive manufacturing processes, the transportation of components and final product (assumed average global logistics), typical use phase energy consumption for a high-performance laptop (estimated around 1000 hours per year over a 5-year lifespan), and end-of-life disposal scenarios (including recycling and landfill). The most recent emission factors from the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) and Ecoinvent databases were used. Given the high-performance nature and robust build of ThinkPads, an estimation of 800 kg CO2e for the entire life cycle (cradle to grave) was derived."

    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint reports or environmental product declarations (EPD) were found for the ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 AMD from the manufacturer. Therefore, an estimation was conducted based on the guidelines of the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067. The estimation considered: \n1. **Main materials composition**: Typical materials for a laptop include aluminum, plastic, glass, and circuit boards. Assuming similar material distribution as other comparable laptops.\n2. **Manufacturing processes**: Energy-intensive processes including metal refining, plastic production, and assembly. Emission factors from the ecoinvent database were used.\n3. **Transportation**: Average transport distances for components and final product from manufacturers to retailers. Emission factors based on typical transportation modes (sea, air, and ground).\n4. **Use phase energy consumption**: Estimated based on typical usage scenarios (8 hours daily use over a 5-year lifespan) and average power consumption of similar devices. Data from IEA and EPA were referenced.\n5. **End-of-life disposal**: Assumptions based on recycling rates and disposal methods for electronic waste. Data sourced from the UN Global E-waste Statistics Partnership.\n\nThe resulting estimated CO2e emissions are 715 kg for the entire life cycle of the ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 AMD."

    "product_name": "Galaxy S24 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 100,
    "explanation": "Given the Galaxy S24 Ultra, official carbon footprint reports or Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) from the manufacturer are not available publicly. Hence, emissions have been estimated following established protocols such as the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044 for LCA principles, and PAS 2050/ISO/TS 14067 for carbon footprint calculations. The estimation considers the product throughout its life cycle (cradle to grave): main materials composition (aluminum, glass, plastics, batteries), manufacturing processes (energy-intensive production), transportation (global logistics), use phase energy consumption (standby and active usage), and end-of-life disposal (recycling potential). Recent emission factors and scientific data were utilized from recognized databases such as the ECOINVENT database and ILCD handbook. The estimated CO2e emissions are provided as an approximation, subject to variations in specific manufacturing practices and regional energy mixes. Since no manufacturer data is available for this specific model, the figure represents a general estimation based on similar high-end smartphones and current industry practices."
