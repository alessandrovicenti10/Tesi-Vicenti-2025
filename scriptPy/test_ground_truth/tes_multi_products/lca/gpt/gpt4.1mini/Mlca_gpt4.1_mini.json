    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint reports or Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) were found for the Lenovo ThinkVision T24i-30 / P24i-30 / TIO Flex 24i monitors. Therefore, the CO2e emissions estimate is based on a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. The estimate includes: 1) Materials: typical LCD monitor composition with plastics, glass, aluminum, and electronic components, estimated at approximately 4.5-5 kg total weight; 2) Manufacturing: energy-intensive processes for display panel and electronics assembly, estimated at ~30-40 kg CO2e; 3) Transportation: assuming global shipping from manufacturing sites in Asia to Europe/North America, estimated at ~5-10 kg CO2e; 4) Use phase: average power consumption of ~20W, used 8 hours/day over 5 years, resulting in ~70-80 kg CO2e based on average electricity grid emission factors (~0.4 kg CO2e/kWh); 5) End-of-life: recycling and disposal emissions estimated at ~5 kg CO2e. Summing these components yields an estimated total life cycle carbon footprint of approximately 120 kg CO2e per unit. This estimate aligns with published LCA studies of similar 24-inch LCD monitors and is based on the most recent emission factors from the Ecoinvent database and IPCC AR6 guidelines."
