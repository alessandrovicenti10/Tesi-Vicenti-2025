Therefore, the estimate is based on a life cycle assessment following the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/44 principles. The estimation considers the following components: materials (aluminum, glass, plastics, rare earth elements), manufacturing energy (primarily in China), transportation (global shipping and distribution), use phase energy consumption (average daily charging over 2 years), and end-of-life disposal (recycling and landfill). Using recent emission factors from the Ecoinvent database and scientific literature, the total cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions are approximated at 15 kg per device. This estimate aligns with published data for comparable smartphones, which typically range from 10 to 20 kg CO2e per unit."
