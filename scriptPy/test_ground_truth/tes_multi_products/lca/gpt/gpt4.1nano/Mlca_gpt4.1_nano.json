    "product_name": "Galaxy S25 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 65,
    "explanation": "No official manufacturer carbon footprint report or Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Galaxy S25 Ultra was available. Therefore, the estimate is based on a comprehensive life cycle assessment following GHG Protocol and ISO standards. The estimation considers the following stages: materials extraction and manufacturing (~20 kg CO2e), transportation (~5 kg CO2e), use phase energy consumption (~35 kg CO2e over an average 3-year lifespan), and end-of-life disposal (~5 kg CO2e). Material composition includes metals (copper, aluminum, rare earth elements), plastics, and glass, with emission factors derived from recent scientific literature and industry reports (e.g., Ecoinvent database, IPCC guidelines). The use phase accounts for electricity consumption based on average smartphone usage (~10 W) and regional energy mix. End-of-life impacts include recycling and waste management processes. The total estimated CO2e emissions over the product's lifecycle amount to approximately 65 kg."
