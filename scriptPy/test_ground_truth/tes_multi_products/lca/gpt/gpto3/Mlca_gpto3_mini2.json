    "explanation": "No official manufacturer carbon footprint report or environmental product declaration specifically for the iPhone 16 128GB was found. Therefore, the cradle‐to‐grave CO2e emission estimate is derived using standard LCA protocols (GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067). In this estimation, key life cycle stages were considered: raw material extraction (aluminum, glass, plastics, semiconductors, battery materials), manufacturing processes (including energy‐intensive component production and assembly), transportation (from production sites to global markets), the use phase (energy consumption during an assumed typical usage period), and end‐of‐life processing (recycling and proper disposal). Emission factors from recent scientific literature and databases (e.g., ecoinvent) were applied alongside industry averages for similar smartphone models. Based on these assumptions and calculations, the estimated total cradle‐to‐grave carbon footprint for an iPhone 16 128GB is approximately 75 kg CO2e. Note that this is an approximation and actual emissions may vary with changes in manufacturing practices, usage behavior, and recycling efficiencies."

    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint report or Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) from the manufacturer for the iPhone 16e 128GB was found. Therefore, the following estimation has been performed based on standard LCA procedures, including the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044 for LCA principles, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 for carbon footprint calculation. The estimation considers emissions from material extraction (mainly metals, glass, and plastics), manufacturing processes (which have been identified as the major contributor in smartphones, e.g., semiconductor production, assembly, and testing), transportation of components and finished product, the use phase (energy consumed during charging and operation over the product’s lifetime) and end-of-life activities (recycling and disposal). Based on current scientific literature and emission factors commonly used for smartphone assessments, the overall life cycle CO2e emissions are estimated at approximately 75 kg CO2e per unit. Assumptions include a manufacturing contribution of roughly 55 kg CO2e, around 10 kg CO2e from raw material extraction, 5 kg CO2e for logistics, with the use phase and end-of-life phases contributing the remaining emissions. All data and assumptions are aligned with recent smartphone LCA studies and carbon footprint assessments published in the scientific and industry literature."

The estimation process considered key phases: (1) Raw material extraction and processing with emphasis on primary electronics materials (metals such as aluminum, rare earths for electronics, glass, plastics), (2) Manufacturing processes including semiconductor fabrication, component assembly and final integration all of which are energy-intensive, (3) Transportation steps from global sourcing of components to distribution to end-users, (4) Use phase energy consumption associated with typical operation over the product’s lifetime, and (5) End-of-life processing including recycling and waste management. Emission factors from academic literature and industry benchmarks (e.g., estimates of energy use and carbon intensity in electronics manufacturing and transport) were applied alongside assumptions on material composition and device weight. Based on these assumptions, a cradle-to-grave footprint of approximately 75 kg CO2e was derived. This value is an estimation and actual emissions may vary depending on specific supply chain configurations, regional energy mixes, and usage patterns."

Following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067, the analysis considered cradle‐to‐grave emissions including: (1) material extraction and processing (e.g., metals, plastics, glass, and other key components), (2) manufacturing and assembly processes (energy-intensive operations common in electronics manufacturing), (3) transportation from production sites (typically in Asia) to global markets, (4) the use phase (estimating power consumption typical for high-performance laptops over an assumed useful life), and (5) end‐of‐life treatment (recycling and disposal scenarios). Emission factors from recent databases (e.g., Ecoinvent and DEFRA) and scientific literature were used to inform each stage. Based on these assumptions and comparisons with similar product assessments in the literature, the overall estimated cradle‐to‐grave carbon footprint is approximately 350 kg CO2e per unit."

    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint report or environmental product declaration was found for the ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 AMD. Therefore, an estimation was performed following the GHG Protocol Product Standard for system boundaries and ISO 14040/14044 LCA principles. The estimation considered emissions from the entire life cycle: \n- Materials and manufacturing: Based on literature estimates for laptops, the production phase (materials extraction, component manufacturing, assembly) is assumed to contribute roughly 250 kg CO2e. \n- Transportation: Logistics from production facilities to market are estimated to add about 20 kg CO2e. \n- Use phase: Assuming typical energy consumption for a modern laptop over a usage period of 3–4 years and applying recent grid emission factors, the use phase is estimated to add around 30 kg CO2e. \n- End-of-life: Disposal, recycling and waste management processes are estimated to contribute an additional 20 kg CO2e. \nEmission factors were derived from current scientific literature and standard LCA databases (e.g., Ecoinvent, DEFRA, EPA) while following protocols from PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 for carbon footprint calculations. These assumptions yield an estimated cradle-to-grave total of approximately 350 kg CO2e. All values are indicative and may vary based on specific manufacturing practices, regional energy mixes, and actual use conditions."

    "co2e_kg": 75,
    "explanation": "No official carbon footprint report or environmental product declaration from the manufacturer was found for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Therefore, the estimate was derived using established LCA protocols. Based on the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 guidelines, the estimation considered the major life cycle stages: material extraction and production (mainly metals, plastics, glass and trace critical materials), manufacturing processes (which typically account for roughly 60-70% of total emissions for smartphones), transportation logistics, use phase energy consumption (assuming an average operational period of 2 years), and end‐of‐life management (including recycling and disposal). Recent emission factors from sources such as the IPCC reports and peer-reviewed LCA studies were used to approximate these stages. In similar studies, high-end smartphones have been estimated to have a cradle‐to‐grave CO2e impact in the range of 70–80 kg. With these considerations and assumptions, the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s life cycle CO2e emission is estimated at approximately 75 kg CO2e."

    "explanation": "No official manufacturer carbon footprint report or environmental product declaration (EPD) was found for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Therefore, the CO2e estimate was developed using an LCA approach following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. Assumptions include: approximately 35–40 kg CO2e from raw material extraction and production (metals, glass, rare earth elements, and battery materials), about 10–15 kg CO2e from the manufacturing processes, roughly 2–3 kg CO2e from transportation of components and finished product, 5–7 kg CO2e from the use phase energy consumption over an assumed lifespan of 2–3 years, and an estimated 3–5 kg CO2e from end-of-life treatment (recycling/disposal). Recent emission factors and scientific data from published smartphone LCA studies and industry averages were used as the basis for this estimation, leading to a total life cycle CO2e estimate of approximately 75 kg."
