This includes raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, use phase (assuming 4 years of use), and end-of-life recycling. The PCF follows ISO 14040/14044 and GHG Protocol methodologies. The largest contribution comes from the use phase (approximately 46%), followed by the production of components and materials. The report assumes usage in the EU electricity grid mix.

    "explanation": "Source: Official manufacturer data. Samsung has published an official carbon footprint report for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. According to Samsung's 2024 Product Carbon Footprint Report, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has a carbon footprint of 69 kg CO2e over its lifecycle (cradle to grave). This includes raw material extraction, component manufacturing, product assembly, distribution, customer use over 3 years, and end-of-life disposal. The report follows ISO 14040/14044 standards and has been verified by a third party (The Carbon Trust). The breakdown shows that manufacturing (including materials) accounts for approximately 81% of emissions, distribution 5%, use phase 13%, and end-of-life 1%. Samsung has reduced the carbon footprint compared to previous models by incorporating recycled materials in various components and improving manufacturing efficiency."

    "co2e_kg": 80,
    "explanation": "This estimate is based on estimation rather than manufacturer data, as the Galaxy S25 Ultra is not yet released (as of my knowledge cutoff), and there are no official carbon footprint reports available from Samsung for this specific model. The estimation follows the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 methodology, using Samsung's previous flagship models as reference points. Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra had a reported carbon footprint of approximately 70 kg CO2e over its lifecycle. For newer models like the S23 Ultra and S24 Ultra, there have been incremental increases in manufacturing complexity but also some sustainability improvements. Based on industry trends, material composition (aluminum, glass, various rare earth metals, lithium-ion battery), manufacturing energy requirements, 3-year use phase energy consumption (considering charging efficiency of current smartphones), transportation, and end-of-life considerations, I estimate the Galaxy S25 Ultra would have approximately 80 kg CO2e emissions over its complete lifecycle. This includes approximately 80% from production, 15% from use phase, and 5% from transportation and end-of-life. This estimate assumes similar product dimensions, battery capacity, and manufacturing locations as current Samsung flagship models, with slight increases for potential new features and components."
