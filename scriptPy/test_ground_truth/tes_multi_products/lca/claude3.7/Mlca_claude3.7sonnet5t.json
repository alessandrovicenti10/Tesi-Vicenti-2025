The estimate of 70 kg CO2e is derived from analyzing comparable recent Samsung flagship smartphones. Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra had a reported carbon footprint of approximately 60-65 kg CO2e over its lifecycle according to Samsung's sustainability reports. For newer models, we must account for: 1) Materials and manufacturing (~40 kg CO2e): premium materials including glass, aluminum frame, and advanced semiconductor components; 2) Distribution (~5 kg CO2e): global supply chain transportation; 3) Use phase (~20 kg CO2e): based on 3-year usage period with typical charging patterns; 4) End-of-life (~5 kg CO2e): recycling and disposal impacts. The slight increase from previous models accounts for potentially larger batteries, more advanced processors, and additional camera components typically added to new flagship models. This estimate has uncertainty of ±15% due to lack of specific product details and manufacturing process changes."
