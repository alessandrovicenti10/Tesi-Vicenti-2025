The estimation is based on Samsung's published carbon footprints for similar devices and industry standards. Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra has a reported carbon footprint of approximately 67 kg CO2e according to Samsung's 2023-2024 environmental reports. This includes raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use for 3 years, and end-of-life processing. For the S25 Ultra, I've added a small increase (approximately 3%) to account for potential larger battery capacity and more advanced components. The breakdown is approximately: Materials and manufacturing (79% or ~54.5 kg), Distribution (5% or ~3.5 kg), Use phase (15% or ~10.3 kg), and End-of-life (1% or ~0.7 kg). This estimate follows GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 principles by considering the full life cycle. If Samsung releases an official carbon footprint for the S25 Ultra in the future, that would supersede this estimate."
