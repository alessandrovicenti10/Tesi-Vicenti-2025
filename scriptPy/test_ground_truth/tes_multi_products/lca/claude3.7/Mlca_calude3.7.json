    "product_name": "Galaxy S25 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 60,
    "explanation": "This is an estimation as the Galaxy S25 Ultra has not been released yet, and no official carbon footprint report exists. The estimate is based on Samsung's carbon footprint data for similar recent products. Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra has a reported carbon footprint of approximately 57 kg CO2e over its lifecycle according to Samsung's 2023-2024 product environmental reports. For the S25 Ultra, I've added a small increase (approximately 5%) to account for potential increases in manufacturing complexity and battery capacity. The lifecycle emissions are typically distributed as: Materials extraction and manufacturing (80-85%), transportation (5-7%), use phase (7-10%), and end-of-life (1-2%). The estimate assumes a 3-year usage period with global average electricity grid intensity. Major contributors are the integrated circuit components (particularly the system-on-chip and memory), display manufacturing, and aluminum/glass casing production. This estimation follows GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 methodologies for system boundaries and calculation approaches."
