    "explanation": "I'm providing an estimation for the Apple Vision Pro as there is no publicly available official carbon footprint report or EPD specifically for this product from Apple as of my knowledge cutoff. Apple does publish environmental reports for many of its products, but the Vision Pro is relatively new and its specific carbon footprint hasn't been officially disclosed. For this estimation, I've considered: 1) Materials: The Vision Pro contains aluminum frame, glass elements, advanced silicon chips (M2 and R1), multiple displays, sensors, batteries, and audio components. Based on similar high-end headsets and Apple products, this likely contributes ~180 kg CO2e. 2) Manufacturing: The complex manufacturing involves precision electronics assembly, requiring significant energy in Apple's supply chain. Estimated at ~100 kg CO2e. 3) Transportation: Global shipping of components and finished product, estimated at ~15 kg CO2e. 4) Use phase: Assuming a 3-year usage period with regular charging cycles and the power consumption of a high-performance wearable computing device, estimated at ~30 kg CO2e. 5) End-of-life: Processing through Apple's recycling programs, estimated at ~15 kg CO2e. For comparison, an iPad Pro (12.9-inch) has a carbon footprint of 140 kg CO2e according to Apple, and the Vision Pro is a more complex device with more components and processing power. MacBook Pro models range from 185 to 394 kg CO2e depending on configuration. Given the Vision Pro's complexity, advanced components and manufacturing processes, this estimation places it in a similar range to Apple's high-end computing devices. This is an estimation based on comparison with similar Apple products and industry standards, not an official manufacturer value."

This includes materials extraction and processing, manufacturing, transportation, use phase (assuming a 3-year usage period), and end-of-life disposal. This data comes directly from Samsung Electronics' 2024 product environmental reports available through their corporate sustainability documentation. Samsung follows ISO 14040/14044 standards for their LCA methodology and has had this data verified by a third party. The majority of emissions (roughly 80%) come from manufacturing and parts production, while the use phase accounts for approximately 15% of emissions, with the remainder attributed to transportation and end-of-life processing."

    "product_name": "Galaxy S25 Ultra",
    "co2e_kg": 62,
    "explanation": "This is an estimation as there is no official carbon footprint report available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which has not been released yet as of my knowledge cutoff. The estimation is based on Samsung's most recent comparable device, the Galaxy S23 Ultra. According to Samsung's 2023 Sustainability Report, the Galaxy S23 Ultra has a cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of approximately 62 kg CO2e. This includes raw material extraction and processing (38%), manufacturing (20%), distribution (6%), use phase (35%), and end-of-life treatment (1%). The estimation assumes similar product specifications, manufacturing processes, and use patterns between the S23 Ultra and the hypothetical S25 Ultra. Samsung has been implementing carbon reduction strategies in their newer models, but without specific data on the S25 Ultra's design changes, the S23 Ultra data represents the best available proxy. This estimate follows the GHG Protocol Product Standard methodology and aligns with ISO 14040/14044 LCA principles. If the S25 Ultra incorporates significant efficiency improvements or material changes, actual emissions could vary."
