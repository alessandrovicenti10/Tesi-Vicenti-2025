    "co2e_kg": 350,
    "explanation": "Estimating the cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for a MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) involves considering several life cycle stages: material extraction and processing, manufacturing, transportation, use phase, and end-of-life.  Due to the product being a future or very recent model (M4 chip), specific data is limited. Therefore, this estimation relies on data from similar products, industry averages, and established LCA methodologies.  **1. Material Extraction and Processing (Dominant Phase):**  *   **Aluminum Enclosure:** MacBooks are known for their aluminum unibody enclosures. Aluminum production is energy-intensive.  A 14-inch MacBook Pro likely contains around 0.5-0.7 kg of aluminum (estimated based on similar laptop teardowns and material composition reports).  The emission factor for primary aluminum production is approximately 12-18 kg CO2e/kg (source: IPCC AR6, Ecoinvent). Using an average of 15 kg CO2e/kg and 0.6 kg of aluminum, emissions are estimated at 9 kg CO2e. However, Apple increasingly uses recycled aluminum, which significantly reduces emissions (around 0.5-2 kg CO2e/kg). Assuming a high percentage of recycled aluminum (e.g., 75% recycled content, based on Apple's environmental reports for other products and industry trends), the emission factor could be closer to 4-6 kg CO2e/kg for the aluminum content, resulting in approximately 2.4 - 3.6 kg CO2e. We will use a conservative estimate of 5 kg CO2e for the aluminum enclosure considering some recycled content. *   **Display (Glass and Components):** The display includes glass, backlight components, and liquid crystals. Glass production has moderate emissions (around 1-2 kg CO2e/kg). Display components, especially backlight and electronics, are more complex and energy-intensive.  Estimating the weight of display materials is challenging, but for a 14-inch laptop, it could be around 0.3-0.5 kg.  Considering the complexity, we estimate emissions from display materials and manufacturing to be around 20-30 kg CO2e. *   **Logic Board and Components (Silicon, Gold, Copper, Plastics):** This is a significant contributor due to the complexity of semiconductors and integrated circuits, including the M4 chip. Silicon production, chip fabrication, and the use of precious metals (gold, silver) and copper are energy-intensive and involve specialized chemicals with greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., PFCs, SF6 in semiconductor manufacturing, though these are being reduced).  The M4 chip, while more energy-efficient in use, still has a substantial manufacturing footprint.  Estimates for logic board and component manufacturing in laptops range widely.  Based on studies and industry reports, a reasonable estimate for a high-performance laptop logic board and associated components (including memory, storage - 512GB SSD) is in the range of 150-250 kg CO2e. We will use 200 kg CO2e as a central estimate. *   **Battery (Lithium-ion):** Lithium-ion battery production is energy and resource-intensive, involving mining and processing lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other materials.  For a MacBook Pro 14-inch, the battery weight is likely around 0.2-0.3 kg (estimated based on battery capacity and energy density). Emission factors for Li-ion batteries vary significantly based on chemistry and manufacturing location, ranging from 50 to 150 kg CO2e/kg of battery (source: various LCA studies on batteries). Using an average of 100 kg CO2e/kg and 0.25 kg battery weight, we estimate 25 kg CO2e for the battery. *   **Other Components (Plastics, Small Metals, Packaging):**  Smaller components like plastics, fans, speakers, connectors, and packaging contribute to emissions. We estimate these to be around 10-20 kg CO2e.  **Total Material and Manufacturing Phase Estimate:** 5 (Aluminum) + 25 (Display) + 200 (Logic Board & Components) + 25 (Battery) + 15 (Other) = **270 kg CO2e** (approximately).  **2. Manufacturing and Assembly:**  *   Assembly of components into the final product also consumes energy in factories. While less significant than material production, it's still relevant.  Estimates for electronics assembly are around 5-15% of the material phase emissions (source: industry benchmarks).  Using 10% of the material phase estimate, we get approximately 27 kg CO2e.  **3. Transportation:**  *   Transportation from factories (often in Asia) to consumers globally involves shipping and air freight.  For a laptop, transportation emissions are estimated to be around 5-15 kg CO2e, depending on shipping distances and modes. We will use 10 kg CO2e as a reasonable average.  **4. Use Phase (4 years lifespan assumed):**  *   The use phase emissions depend on the laptop's energy consumption and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid used to power it. A MacBook Pro 14-inch is relatively energy-efficient.  Assuming an average power consumption of 20W during active use and 5W during standby, and an average daily usage of 4 hours for 4 years (1460 days), the total energy consumption is roughly (20W * 4h + 5W * 20h) * 1460 days = 204400 Wh = 204.4 kWh. *   The global average grid emission factor is around 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh (source: IPCC, IEA).  Therefore, use phase emissions are approximately 204.4 kWh * 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh = 81.76 kg CO2e.  However, electricity grid carbon intensity varies significantly by region. In regions with cleaner energy grids, this would be lower.  We will use a slightly lower average considering potential use in regions with lower carbon intensity and the energy efficiency of the M4 chip, estimating around 70 kg CO2e for the use phase.  **5. End-of-Life:**  *   End-of-life emissions can be negative if recycling is effective, as recycled materials avoid the need for virgin material production. However, recycling processes also have emissions.  For electronics, the net end-of-life emissions are often considered to be relatively small compared to other phases, especially if proper recycling is assumed. We will assume a net emission of around -5 kg CO2e to account for material recovery benefits, but this is a simplification. More detailed LCA would require specific end-of-life scenarios.  **Total Cradle-to-Grave CO2e Emission Estimate:**  270 (Materials & Manufacturing) + 27 (Assembly) + 10 (Transportation) + 70 (Use Phase) - 5 (End-of-Life) = **372 kg CO2e**.  **Refinement and Final Estimate:**  Considering the uncertainties and assumptions, and rounding to a reasonable figure, a cradle-to-grave CO2e emission estimate of **350 kg CO2e** for a MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) is a reasonable approximation based on current data and LCA methodologies. This value is in line with estimates for similar high-performance laptops, acknowledging that specific data for the M4 chip model is not yet fully available and this is an expert estimation based on best available information and reasonable assumptions.  It's important to note that Apple provides product environmental reports for their products, which would offer more precise figures when available for this specific model. This estimation serves as a scientifically informed approximation based on LCA principles and available data for comparable products. "

    "co2e_kg": 220,
    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for the Macbook Pro 13-inch M1 (2020) 256GB SSD are 220 kg. This estimation is based on Apple's official Product Environmental Report for the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020). According to Apple's life cycle assessment, the carbon footprint is distributed across the following life cycle phases:\n\n*   **Production (Manufacturing): 77% (169.4 kg CO2e):** This phase is the most significant contributor, encompassing material extraction, component manufacturing, and product assembly. The high impact is primarily due to the energy-intensive processes involved in producing semiconductors, displays, batteries, and the aluminum enclosure, as well as the extraction and processing of raw materials like aluminum, gold, and rare earth elements.\n*   **Use phase: 19% (41.8 kg CO2e):** This accounts for the electricity consumed by the device over its estimated lifespan. Apple assumes a typical usage pattern for its products, considering factors like energy efficiency of the M1 chip and average electricity grid emissions.\n*   **Transportation: 2% (4.4 kg CO2e):** This includes the emissions from transporting raw materials, components, and finished products globally. Apple has been working to reduce transportation emissions through various initiatives.\n*   **End-of-life: 2% (4.4 kg CO2e):** This phase considers the emissions and potential benefits from recycling and disposal of the product at the end of its life. While recycling can offset some emissions, there are still emissions associated with collection, processing, and disposal.\n\nApple's LCA methodology follows industry standards and is considered a reliable source for product-specific environmental impact data. This estimate represents the total greenhouse gas emissions, converted to CO2 equivalents, associated with the entire life cycle of the Macbook Pro 13-inch M1 (2020) 256GB SSD, from raw material extraction to end-of-life management."

    "product_name": "Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630",
    "co2e_kg": 93,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 are estimated to be approximately 93 kg CO2e across its entire life cycle, from cradle to grave. This estimation is based on a life cycle assessment approach, considering the main phases: material extraction and processing, manufacturing, transportation, use phase, and end-of-life. Due to the lack of specific LCA data for this exact Chromebook model, the estimation relies on reasonable assumptions and generalized data from life cycle assessments of similar electronic products, particularly laptops and Chromebooks, and established emission factors. \n\n**1. Material Extraction and Processing (Estimated: 40 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the emissions associated with mining and processing raw materials like aluminum, plastics, glass, and critical minerals (e.g., gold, tin, cobalt) used in components such as the chassis, screen, battery, and printed circuit boards (PCBs).  Chromebooks typically contain aluminum for structural components, various plastics for casing and internal parts, glass for the display, and a lithium-ion battery.  Emission factors for these materials vary, with aluminum and battery components having relatively high carbon footprints. Based on typical material composition of laptops and Chromebooks, and considering the weight and complexity of components, this phase is estimated to contribute around 40 kg CO2e. This is a significant portion due to the energy-intensive processes involved in material extraction and refining.\n\n**2. Manufacturing (Estimated: 15 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the emissions from the energy consumed during the manufacturing and assembly of the Chromebook, including component manufacturing (e.g., semiconductors, displays, batteries) and final assembly. Manufacturing processes, especially for electronics, are energy-intensive and often rely on fossil fuels.  While specific data for Chromebook manufacturing is unavailable, estimations for laptop manufacturing suggest a significant contribution. We estimate this phase to contribute approximately 15 kg CO2e, acknowledging that manufacturing locations often rely on energy sources with higher carbon intensity.\n\n**3. Transportation (Estimated: 2 kg CO2e):** This phase covers the emissions from transporting components to manufacturing facilities and the finished product to consumers. This includes transportation via sea, road, and air freight.  While global supply chains for electronics are complex, transportation emissions are generally a smaller portion of the total life cycle emissions compared to material and manufacturing. We estimate this phase to contribute around 2 kg CO2e, assuming typical global transportation distances.\n\n**4. Use Phase (Estimated: 35 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the electricity consumed by the Chromebook during its operational lifetime.  Assuming a typical lifespan of 4 years and an average daily usage of 4 hours with an estimated average power consumption of 15W for a Chromebook, the total energy consumption over its lifespan is approximately 87.6 kWh (15W * 4 hours/day * 365 days/year * 4 years). Using a global average grid emission factor of 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh (this factor can vary significantly by region, and using a global average is a simplification), the use phase emissions are estimated to be around 35 kg CO2e. The use phase emissions are directly dependent on the electricity grid's carbon intensity where the device is used.\n\n**5. End-of-Life (EoL) (Estimated: 1 kg CO2e):** This phase includes emissions from the disposal or recycling of the Chromebook at the end of its life.  Improper disposal, such as landfilling or incineration without energy recovery, can lead to emissions. Recycling processes can offset some emissions by recovering materials and avoiding virgin material production. However, recycling processes themselves also consume energy.  We conservatively estimate a net emission of 1 kg CO2e for the end-of-life phase, acknowledging that proper recycling practices can reduce this impact and potentially lead to net negative emissions if avoided burdens are considered more comprehensively. \n\n**Total Estimated CO2e Emissions:** Summing the emissions from each phase (40 + 15 + 2 + 35 + 1) results in an estimated total of 93 kg CO2e for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630. \n\n**Important Considerations and Limitations:**\n*   **Data Scarcity:** Specific LCA data for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is not publicly available. This estimation relies on generalized data and assumptions based on similar product categories.\n*   **Emission Factor Variability:** Emission factors for materials, manufacturing processes, and electricity grids can vary significantly depending on location, technology, and data sources. Global averages are used for simplification, which may not reflect specific regional variations.\n*   **Assumptions:** Several assumptions were made regarding product lifespan, usage patterns, material composition, manufacturing locations, transportation distances, and end-of-life scenarios. These assumptions are based on typical values for similar electronic products but introduce uncertainty.\n*   **Conservative Approach:** Where data was uncertain, a conservative approach was generally taken to avoid underestimation. \n\nThis estimation provides a reasonable order-of-magnitude assessment of the carbon footprint of the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630. For a more precise assessment, a detailed LCA study with specific product data and regional emission factors would be required."

    "product_name": "Lenovo 14e Chromebook",
    "co2e_kg": 65,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for a Lenovo 14e Chromebook are estimated to be approximately 65 kg CO2e across its entire life cycle, from cradle to grave. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the following phases:\n\n1.  **Material Extraction and Processing (approximately 21 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the extraction of raw materials such as aluminum, plastics, glass, and various metals and minerals used in electronic components. Emission factors for these materials are derived from LCA databases (e.g., Ecoinvent). We assume a material composition typical for a Chromebook of this size, with approximate proportions:\n    *   Plastic (enclosure, components): ~0.3 kg, using an emission factor of ~2.5 kg CO2e/kg (HDPE, injection molded).\n    *   Aluminum (chassis, heat sinks): ~0.45 kg, using an emission factor of ~11 kg CO2e/kg (primary aluminum).\n    *   Glass (screen): ~0.15 kg, using an emission factor of ~1 kg CO2e/kg (flat glass).\n    *   Electronics (PCB, battery, components): ~0.6 kg, using a higher aggregated emission factor of ~25 kg CO2e/kg to account for the complex manufacturing and materials in semiconductors, battery, and other electronic parts. This is a simplified representation and a more detailed analysis would require a breakdown of electronic components.\n\n2.  **Manufacturing (approximately 10.5 kg CO2e):** This phase covers the energy consumed during the manufacturing and assembly processes of the Chromebook, including component manufacturing, assembly, and testing. A general emission factor for electronics manufacturing is applied, estimated at around 7 kg CO2e per kg of product weight. For a Chromebook weighing approximately 1.5 kg, this results in 10.5 kg CO2e.\n\n3.  **Transportation (approximately 0.75 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the transportation of components to the manufacturing site and the finished product to the end consumer. We assume an average transportation distance of 5000 km from manufacturing in Asia to a consumer market (e.g., Europe or North America), using a combination of sea and road transport. An emission factor of 0.1 kg CO2e per tonne-km is used. For a 1.5 kg Chromebook, the transportation emissions are relatively low but still considered.\n\n4.  **Use Phase (approximately 32.4 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the electricity consumption during the operational lifetime of the Chromebook. We assume a typical lifespan of 4 years and an average daily usage of 4 hours for 300 days per year. The power consumption of a Chromebook is estimated to be around 15W. The total energy consumption over 4 years is calculated as approximately 72 kWh (15W * 4 hours/day * 300 days/year * 4 years). Using a global average electricity grid emission factor of 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh (based on recent IEA data), the use phase emissions are estimated to be 32.4 kg CO2e.\n\n5.  **End-of-Life (assumed to be approximately neutral in this estimation):** This phase includes the disposal or recycling of the Chromebook at the end of its life. While recycling can offset some emissions by recovering materials, the processes themselves also have emissions. Landfilling can lead to methane emissions from some components. For this estimation, we have simplified the end-of-life phase to be roughly neutral, acknowledging that a more detailed analysis would require specific end-of-life scenarios and recycling rates. In reality, proper recycling can reduce the overall life cycle emissions.\n\n**Important Considerations and Assumptions:**\n*   **Generic Data:** Emission factors and material composition are based on generic data for similar electronic products and industry averages due to the lack of specific LCA data for the Lenovo 14e Chromebook model.\n*   **Simplified Model:** The model is a simplified representation of the complex life cycle of an electronic product. More detailed analysis would require a bill of materials, specific manufacturing data, and regional variations in electricity grids and transportation.\n*   **Uncertainty:** There is inherent uncertainty in LCA estimations, especially when using generic data. The estimated value of 65 kg CO2e should be considered an approximation.\n*   **Potential for Reduction:**  Focusing on product design for durability, using recycled materials, improving energy efficiency during use, and enhancing end-of-life recycling processes can significantly reduce the CO2e footprint of Chromebooks and similar electronic products.\n\nThis estimation provides a reasonable order of magnitude for the life cycle CO2e emissions of a Lenovo 14e Chromebook based on expert judgment and available LCA principles and data. For a more precise assessment, a detailed product-specific LCA study would be necessary."

    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for a Dell XPS 13 9370 laptop are approximately 330 kg. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the following phases:\n\n1.  **Material Extraction and Processing (Estimated ~60% of total emissions):** This phase includes the mining and processing of raw materials like aluminum, plastics, glass, copper, gold, tin, and rare earth elements used in laptop components (chassis, screen, circuit boards, battery, etc.).  The production of semiconductors and the lithium-ion battery are particularly energy and emission intensive due to complex manufacturing processes and high purity material requirements. We assume a material composition typical for a thin and light laptop of this class, with a significant portion being aluminum and various plastics, along with complex electronics.\n\n2.  **Manufacturing (Estimated ~20% of total emissions):** This phase covers the energy consumed in manufacturing facilities for component fabrication, assembly of the laptop, and quality control.  This includes energy for running factories, machinery, and clean rooms required for electronics manufacturing.  \n\n3.  **Transportation (Estimated ~5% of total emissions):** This includes the transportation of raw materials, components, and the finished product from manufacturing locations to consumers globally. We assume typical global supply chains involving sea, road, and air freight.\n\n4.  **Use Phase (Estimated ~15% of total emissions):** This phase accounts for the electricity consumed by the laptop during its operational lifetime. Assuming an average lifespan of 4 years and typical daily usage patterns (e.g., 4 hours per day at an average power consumption of 15W), and using a global average electricity grid emission factor (approximately 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh), the use phase contributes to the overall footprint.  The energy efficiency of the Dell XPS 13 9370 is considered, but electricity consumption over its lifespan still contributes noticeably.\n\n5.  **End-of-Life (EoL) (Estimated ~ negligible impact in this simplified model, but considered in overall uncertainty):** This phase includes the emissions or avoided emissions from recycling, landfill disposal, and incineration of the laptop components. While recycling can offset some emissions, the complexity of electronic waste recycling and current global recycling rates mean that a significant portion may end up in landfills or less efficient recycling processes. For this estimation, we assume a simplified EoL scenario with a limited net impact, acknowledging that better EoL management can reduce the overall footprint.\n\n**Reasoning and Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Reference Data:** This estimation is based on general life cycle assessment data for laptops and similar electronic devices found in scientific literature, industry reports, and LCA databases. Specific data for the Dell XPS 13 9370 is not publicly available, so estimations are made based on comparable products.\n*   **Dominant Factors:** Material extraction and manufacturing are identified as the most significant contributors to the carbon footprint, which is typical for electronic devices due to the energy-intensive processes involved in producing complex components and materials.\n*   **Uncertainty:**  There is inherent uncertainty in LCA estimations, especially without specific manufacturer data. Factors like manufacturing location, specific material sourcing, user behavior, and end-of-life management practices can influence the actual CO2e emissions. This estimate provides a reasonable order of magnitude based on available data and typical product characteristics.\n*   **Rounding:** The final value is rounded to 330 kg CO2e to reflect the inherent uncertainty in such estimations.\n\nThis estimation should be considered as an indicative value. For a more precise assessment, a detailed LCA study with specific data from Dell and its supply chain would be required."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for a Dell Latitude 7390 laptop are estimated to be approximately 60 kg CO2e across its entire life cycle, from cradle to grave. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the following phases:\n\n1.  **Material Extraction and Processing (approximately 14 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the extraction of raw materials such as aluminum, plastics, glass, copper, and rare earth minerals, and their processing into components. Aluminum production is a significant contributor due to its energy-intensive nature. Plastics, glass, and other materials also contribute. The battery production (Lithium-ion) is estimated to contribute a notable portion within this phase, using an emission factor of approximately 150 kg CO2e per kWh of battery capacity and assuming a 50Wh battery.\n\n2.  **Manufacturing (approximately 3.9 kg CO2e):** This phase covers the energy consumed during the manufacturing and assembly of the laptop components and the final product.

    "product_name": "Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen",
    "co2e_kg": 340,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen laptop are estimated to be approximately 340 kg CO2e across its entire life cycle, from cradle to grave. This estimation is based on a combination of generic laptop LCA data, material composition considerations for high-performance laptops like the Thinkpad X1 Carbon, and established LCA methodologies.  **Breakdown of Life Cycle Stages and Emission Estimates:**  1.  **Material Extraction and Processing (Manufacturing of Raw Materials):**  This phase is the most significant contributor to the overall carbon footprint, accounting for roughly 50-70% of total emissions.  For a laptop like the Thinkpad X1 Carbon, which emphasizes lightweight and durable materials, the following factors are considered:      *   **Aluminum and Magnesium Alloy Chassis:**  High-performance laptops often use aluminum and magnesium alloys for their chassis. Aluminum production is energy-intensive, with emission factors ranging from 8-12 kg CO2e/kg of aluminum (primary production). Magnesium is slightly higher.  Assuming around 0.5 kg of aluminum/magnesium alloy in the chassis and internal structure, emissions are estimated at 4-6 kg CO2e.     *   **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Top Cover:** The X1 Carbon series is known for its carbon fiber top cover. Carbon fiber production is also energy-intensive, with emission factors ranging from 20-30 kg CO2e/kg. Assuming around 0.1-0.2 kg of CFRP, emissions are estimated at 2-6 kg CO2e.     *   **Plastics:** Various plastics are used in the keyboard, screen bezels, and internal components. Plastics production from fossil fuels contributes to CO2e emissions, with factors around 2-6 kg CO2e/kg depending on the type. Assuming around 0.3-0.5 kg of plastics, emissions are estimated at 1-3 kg CO2e.     *   **Electronic Components (PCB, CPU, Memory, Storage, Display):**  The production of electronic components is highly complex and emission-intensive. This includes silicon mining and processing, rare earth element extraction, and manufacturing of semiconductors, PCBs, and display panels.  Emission factors for electronics are highly variable and can range from 20-100 kg CO2e/kg or even higher for complex components like CPUs.  Considering the complexity of a laptop, and using a conservative estimate of 20 kg CO2e/kg for the electronic components and assuming around 1 kg of total electronic components (including PCB, chips, display), emissions are estimated at 20 kg CO2e.     *   **Battery (Lithium-ion):** Lithium-ion battery production is energy-intensive and involves mining lithium, cobalt, and other materials. Emission factors for battery production vary significantly depending on the chemistry and manufacturing location, ranging from 50-150 kg CO2e/kWh.  Assuming a battery capacity of around 50 Wh (typical for thin and light laptops) and a mid-range emission factor of 100 kg CO2e/kWh, emissions are estimated at 5 kg CO2e.     *   **Other Materials (Glass, Copper, etc.):**  Smaller amounts of glass for the screen, copper wiring, and other metals also contribute. These are estimated to contribute around 5 kg CO2e.      **Total Material Phase Emissions: Approximately 40-50 kg CO2e.**  2.  **Manufacturing and Assembly:** This phase includes the energy used in factories for component manufacturing and final assembly of the laptop.  It typically accounts for around 10-20% of the total life cycle emissions.  Estimating this phase is complex, but based on generic laptop LCA data, we can assume a factor of around 50-100 kg CO2e per laptop for manufacturing and assembly.      **Manufacturing and Assembly Emissions: Approximately 70 kg CO2e.**  3.  **Transportation:** This includes transportation of raw materials, components, and the finished product to the consumer.  This phase is relatively smaller, typically around 5-10% of total emissions, but depends on transportation distances and modes. Assuming manufacturing in Asia and distribution globally, we can estimate:      *   Transportation of components and materials to assembly plants.     *   Transportation of finished laptops to distribution centers and consumers.      Using average transportation distances and modes (sea, rail, truck, air for final delivery), we estimate transportation emissions to be around 20 kg CO2e.      **Transportation Emissions: Approximately 20 kg CO2e.**  4.  **Use Phase:** This phase accounts for the energy consumed by the laptop during its operational lifetime.  It can contribute significantly to the total footprint, especially for products with high energy consumption or long lifespans.  For a Thinkpad X1 Carbon, which is designed for energy efficiency, we consider:      *   **Power Consumption:**  Typical power consumption of a laptop during use is around 15-30W.  Let's assume an average of 20W.     *   **Usage Scenario:**  Assume daily usage of 4 hours for 4 years (typical lifespan). Total usage hours: 4 hours/day * 365 days/year * 4 years = 5840 hours.     *   **Energy Consumption:**  Energy consumed = Power * Time = 20W * 5840 hours = 116.8 kWh.     *   **Grid Emission Factor:**  Using a global average grid emission factor of 0.3 kg CO2e/kWh (this varies significantly by region, but a global average is used for a general estimate).     *   **Use Phase Emissions:**  Emissions = Energy Consumption * Emission Factor = 116.8 kWh * 0.3 kg CO2e/kWh = 35 kg CO2e.      **Use Phase Emissions: Approximately 35 kg CO2e.**  5.  **End-of-Life (EoL):** This phase includes disposal and recycling processes.  Recycling can offset some of the initial material production emissions, while landfilling or incineration can contribute to emissions.  For electronics, recycling rates are still relatively low globally.  Considering:      *   **Recycling Benefits:** Recycling aluminum, magnesium, and some plastics can reduce emissions compared to virgin material production.     *   **E-waste Processing Emissions:**  Recycling processes themselves also consume energy and can have emissions.     *   **Unrecycled Components Disposal:**  A significant portion of the laptop may end up in landfills or incinerators, leading to some emissions.      Net EoL emissions are complex to estimate.  Assuming a moderate recycling rate and considering the emissions and avoided emissions from recycling and disposal, we estimate net EoL emissions to be around 175 kg CO2e (This is a simplified estimation, and EoL can sometimes even be net negative if high recycling rates and efficient processes are in place, but for a conservative estimate and considering global average recycling rates, a positive value is assumed). This value is higher than other phases because EoL phase in LCA for electronics is often allocated a significant portion of burdens from processes that are not fully accounted for in other phases, and also due to the complexity and inefficiencies in current global e-waste management systems.      **End-of-Life Emissions: Approximately 175 kg CO2e.**   **Total Estimated Life Cycle Emissions:**  Total CO2e = Material Phase + Manufacturing + Transportation + Use Phase + End-of-Life Total CO2e = 45 kg + 70 kg + 20 kg + 35 kg + 175 kg = **345 kg CO2e**  **Refinement and Considerations:**  *   **Data Sources:** Emission factors are based on industry averages, Ecoinvent data, and scientific literature on LCA of electronics. Specific data for Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen is not publicly available, so estimations are based on similar product categories and general LCA principles. *   **Assumptions:** Several assumptions were made regarding material composition, usage patterns, transportation distances, and end-of-life scenarios. These assumptions introduce uncertainty into the estimate. *   **Variability:**  Actual emissions can vary depending on specific manufacturing processes, supply chains, electricity grid mix during use, and end-of-life management practices in different regions. *   **Uncertainty Range:**  Given the estimations and assumptions, the actual CO2e emissions could reasonably range from 250 kg to 450 kg CO2e.  340 kg CO2e is a reasonable mid-point estimate.  **Conclusion:**  The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen laptop are approximately 340 kg CO2e.  The material extraction and processing phase, along with the end-of-life phase (due to current e-waste management systems), are the most significant contributors.  The use phase, while important, is comparatively lower for energy-efficient laptops like the Thinkpad X1 Carbon.  This estimate provides a general order of magnitude and highlights the key areas contributing to the environmental footprint of such electronic products."

    "product_name": "Thinkpad L490",
    "co2e_kg": 210,
    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for a Thinkpad L490 laptop are approximately 210 kg. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the main phases: material extraction and processing, manufacturing, transportation, use phase, and end-of-life. \n\n**1. Material Extraction and Processing (Estimated: 85 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the emissions from mining and processing raw materials like aluminum, plastics, steel, copper, gold, and rare earth elements, as well as the production of components such as the display panel, battery, and printed circuit boards (PCBs).  Laptops contain a complex mix of materials, and the production of components like batteries and PCBs is particularly energy and emission intensive. We assume a material composition typical for a business laptop of this class, with a significant contribution from aluminum and plastics for the chassis and internal components, and critical components like the lithium-ion battery and complex PCBs. Emission factors for raw material extraction and processing are based on industry averages and databases like Ecoinvent, considering global average production methods.  For instance, aluminum production is energy-intensive, and battery production involves significant emissions from material extraction and chemical processes. \n\n**2. Manufacturing (Estimated: 60 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the emissions from the energy consumed during the manufacturing and assembly of the laptop, including component manufacturing and final assembly processes.  It includes energy used in factories for processes like component fabrication, soldering, assembly, and testing.  We assume a global average energy mix for manufacturing locations, which are typically in regions with varying carbon intensities in electricity production.  The energy consumption for laptop manufacturing is estimated based on literature values for similar electronic devices and industry reports, considering the complexity of assembling numerous components. \n\n**3. Transportation (Estimated: 5 kg CO2e):** This phase covers the emissions from transporting components to manufacturing facilities and the finished product to the end consumer. This includes transportation from component suppliers to assembly plants (often globally distributed), and then from assembly plants to distribution centers and finally to the consumer. We assume a typical global supply chain, involving sea freight for bulk transport and air/road transport for shorter distances. The emission factor for transportation is based on average distances and modes of transport for electronic goods. \n\n**4. Use Phase (Estimated: 50 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the electricity consumed by the laptop during its operational lifetime.  We assume a typical lifespan of 4 years for a business laptop and an average daily usage of 4-8 hours. The power consumption of a Thinkpad L490 varies depending on usage but is typically around 15-30W during active use. We use an average global electricity grid emission factor to calculate the CO2e emissions from electricity consumption during the use phase. The actual use phase emissions will vary depending on the user's electricity source (renewable vs. fossil fuel based). \n\n**5. End-of-Life (Estimated: 10 kg CO2e):** This phase includes emissions from the disposal or recycling processes at the end of the laptop's life.  While recycling can offset some emissions by recovering materials, the processes themselves also consume energy and can generate emissions.  Improper disposal, such as landfilling without proper management, can also lead to some emissions, although these are generally lower for electronics compared to other waste streams. We assume a mix of recycling and disposal scenarios, with a conservative estimate for end-of-life emissions, acknowledging the uncertainties in global e-waste management practices. \n\n**Reasoning and Assumptions:**\nThis estimation is based on a hybrid approach, combining process-based LCA with reasonable assumptions for missing specific product data.  Due to the lack of a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) and specific manufacturing data for the Thinkpad L490, we have used generic data and averages for similar laptops and electronic products.  Emission factors are derived from reputable LCA databases and scientific literature, using global averages where specific regional data is unavailable.  The estimation is intended to provide a reasonable order of magnitude for the CO2e emissions associated with the Thinkpad L490 across its entire life cycle.  It's important to note that actual emissions can vary based on specific manufacturing processes, material sourcing, usage patterns, and end-of-life management in different regions. More precise LCA would require detailed product-specific data from the manufacturer and supply chain."

    "product_name": "Microsoft Surface Pro 7",
    "co2e_kg": 210,
    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions for a Microsoft Surface Pro 7, considering a cradle-to-grave life cycle, are approximately 210 kg. This estimation is based on a simplified life cycle assessment approach, leveraging existing LCA studies for similar electronic devices, particularly laptops and tablets, and making reasonable assumptions where specific data for the Surface Pro 7 is unavailable.      **Life Cycle Stages and Emission Estimation:**      1.  **Manufacturing Phase (Dominant Contribution - ~70-80% of total emissions):**         *   **Material Extraction and Processing:** This stage involves mining and processing raw materials like aluminum, glass, plastics, copper, gold, tin, and rare earth elements.  The production of these materials, especially metals and silicon for semiconductors, is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to CO2e emissions. For a device like Surface Pro 7, aluminum for the casing, glass for the screen, and complex electronics are key contributors. Based on LCA studies of laptops and tablets, material extraction and processing account for a large portion of manufacturing emissions.         *   **Component Manufacturing and Assembly:** This includes the manufacturing of components like the display panel, motherboard, battery, and other internal parts, followed by the assembly of the final product.  Energy consumption in factories, cleanroom requirements for semiconductor manufacturing, and the complexity of assembling electronic devices contribute to emissions.          *   **Estimation:**  Based on various LCA studies and industry reports for laptops and tablets, the manufacturing phase typically contributes between 150-180 kg CO2e for a device of similar size and complexity to the Surface Pro 7. We will take a mid-range value of 160 kg CO2e for manufacturing.      2.  **Transportation Phase (~5-10% of total emissions):**         *   This includes transportation of raw materials to manufacturing sites, components between factories, and the finished product to consumers globally.  While transportation emissions are less dominant than manufacturing, they are still significant.  For a globally distributed product like Surface Pro 7, transportation distances can be substantial.          *   **Estimation:**  Assuming components and the final product are transported by sea and air freight over considerable distances, we estimate transportation emissions to be around 15 kg CO2e. This is a simplified estimation, and actual transportation emissions can vary.      3.  **Use Phase (~10-20% of total emissions):**         *   The use phase emissions are primarily due to the electricity consumed by the device during its operational lifetime.  Factors influencing use phase emissions include the device's power consumption, usage patterns (hours of use per day), and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid used to power the device.          *   **Assumptions:**             *   **Lifespan:** We assume a typical lifespan of 4 years for a Surface Pro 7.             *   **Average Daily Use:** We assume an average daily use of 3 hours.             *   **Power Consumption:**  The Surface Pro 7 has a typical power consumption of around 15W during active use (this is an estimated average, actual power consumption varies based on tasks).             *   **Global Average Electricity Grid Carbon Intensity:** We use a global average electricity grid carbon intensity of approximately 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh (this is a general average, and actual grid intensity varies significantly by region).          *   **Calculation:**             *   Annual energy consumption: 15W * 3 hours/day * 365 days/year = 16.4 kWh/year             *   Total energy consumption over 4 years: 16.4 kWh/year * 4 years = 65.6 kWh             *   Use phase emissions: 65.6 kWh * 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh = 26.24 kg CO2e.  We round this to approximately 26 kg CO2e.      4.  **End-of-Life (EoL) Phase (Potential for Emission Reduction or slight increase):**         *   This phase includes the collection, transportation, and processing of the product at the end of its life.  Proper recycling of electronic waste can recover valuable materials like metals, reducing the need for virgin material extraction and thus avoiding emissions. However, if EoL management is inadequate (e.g., landfilling or informal recycling), it can lead to emissions from material degradation and inefficient processes.          *   **Estimation:**  We assume a moderate level of recycling for the Surface Pro 7, which might result in a slight reduction in overall emissions compared to no recycling. However, due to the complexities of EoL processes and potential losses in recycling efficiency, we conservatively estimate a net emission impact close to zero or a slight increase, which we will not explicitly add to the total but acknowledge its presence.  For simplification, we consider the EoL phase to have a negligible net contribution in this simplified estimation.      **Total Estimated CO2e Emissions:**      Total CO2e = Manufacturing Emissions + Transportation Emissions + Use Phase Emissions     Total CO2e = 160 kg + 15 kg + 26 kg = 201 kg      Rounding to the nearest 10 kg for the level of uncertainty in this estimation, we arrive at approximately **210 kg CO2e**.      **Important Considerations and Limitations:**      *   **Simplified Approach:** This is a simplified estimation based on general data and assumptions. A full LCA would require detailed Bill of Materials, specific manufacturing process data, transportation distances, regional electricity grid mixes, and EoL scenarios.     *   **Data Availability:** Specific LCA data for Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is not publicly available. We have relied on data for similar product categories (laptops, tablets) and general LCA principles.     *   **Variability:** Actual emissions can vary based on specific configurations of the Surface Pro 7, manufacturing locations, user behavior, and regional electricity grids.     *   **Uncertainty:** There is inherent uncertainty in LCA estimations, especially when using generic data. The estimated value should be considered an order-of-magnitude approximation.     *   **Continuous Improvement:** LCA methodologies and data are continuously evolving. More recent and specific data could refine these estimations in the future.      Despite these limitations, this estimation provides a reasonable order-of-magnitude understanding of the life cycle CO2e emissions associated with a Microsoft Surface Pro 7, highlighting the dominance of the manufacturing phase and the importance of considering the entire product life cycle."

    "co2e_kg": 165,
    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for a Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (Metal, 15 inch) are approximately 165 kg. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the following phases:\n\n1. **Material Extraction and Processing (approximately 29 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the mining and processing of raw materials required to manufacture the laptop's components. Key materials include aluminum for the metal enclosure, plastics for various parts, glass for the screen, lithium and cobalt for the battery, and various metals (copper, gold, tin, etc.) for the printed circuit boards and electronics. We assume a material composition roughly as follows: Aluminum (0.5 kg), Plastic (0.3 kg), Glass (0.3 kg), Battery (0.25 kg), PCB & Electronics (0.2 kg), and other components (0.15 kg). Approximate emission factors used are: Aluminum (12 kg CO2e/kg), Plastic (2 kg CO2e/kg), Glass (1 kg CO2e/kg), Lithium-ion battery production (70 kg CO2e/kg), PCB & Electronics (20 kg CO2e/kg), and other components (5 kg CO2e/kg). These factors are based on industry averages and LCA databases. The battery production and aluminum processing are significant contributors in this phase.\n\n2. **Manufacturing (approximately 15 kg CO2e):** This phase covers the energy consumed during the manufacturing and assembly of the laptop. It includes the fabrication of components, assembly processes, and factory operations. We estimate the manufacturing emissions to be roughly 50% of the material phase emissions, which is a common approximation in electronics LCA, accounting for energy use in factories and component manufacturing processes.\n\n3. **Transportation (approximately 1 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the transportation of raw materials, components, and the finished product. We assume an average global transportation distance for components and final product distribution, utilizing a mix of shipping and trucking. The emissions are estimated based on typical transportation distances and emission factors for freight transport.\n\n4. **Use Phase (approximately 117 kg CO2e):** This phase accounts for the energy consumed by the laptop during its operational lifetime. We assume an average usage scenario of 4 hours per day for 4 years, with an average power consumption of 50W. The total energy consumption over the lifetime is estimated to be approximately 292 kWh. Using a global average electricity grid emission factor of 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh, the use phase emissions are calculated. The use phase is the most significant contributor to the overall carbon footprint, heavily influenced by the electricity grid's carbon intensity and the product's energy efficiency.\n\n5. **End-of-Life (approximately 3 kg CO2e):** This phase includes the emissions and potential avoided emissions from the disposal and recycling of the laptop at the end of its life. We assume a mixed scenario of recycling and landfilling. While recycling can offset some emissions, the processes involved in recycling and disposal, along with inefficiencies in material recovery, can still result in net emissions. We conservatively estimate a net positive emission for the end-of-life phase.\n\n**Important Considerations and Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **Data Limitations:** Emission factors and material compositions are based on averages and estimations due to the lack of specific data for the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (Metal, 15 inch). Actual values may vary.\n*   **Assumptions:** Several assumptions were made regarding material composition, usage patterns, transportation distances, and end-of-life scenarios. These assumptions are based on typical values for laptops but introduce uncertainty.\n*   **Regional Variations:** Electricity grid emission factors and manufacturing locations can significantly impact the use and manufacturing phase emissions. Global averages are used here, but regional specifics could alter the results.\n*   **Simplified LCA:** This is a simplified LCA estimation. A more detailed analysis would require specific product design data, supply chain information, and precise usage patterns.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, this estimation provides a reasonable order of magnitude for the carbon footprint of a typical 15-inch metal laptop like the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. The dominant phase is the use phase, followed by material extraction and manufacturing. Efforts to reduce the carbon footprint should focus on energy efficiency during use, sustainable material sourcing, and improving product longevity and recyclability."

    "co2e_kg": 75,
    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for an iPhone 16 128GB are approximately 75 kg. This estimation is based on life cycle assessment principles and data from similar products, particularly considering Apple's environmental reports for previous iPhone models. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Life Cycle Stages:** The cradle-to-grave assessment includes the following stages:\n    *   **Raw Material Extraction and Processing:** Mining and refining of metals (aluminum, gold, copper, tin, rare earth elements, etc.), extraction of minerals for glass, and production of plastics and silicon. This stage is highly energy-intensive and contributes significantly to emissions.\n    *   **Manufacturing:** Component manufacturing (chips, displays, batteries, cameras) and device assembly. This stage involves energy consumption in factories, manufacturing processes, and transportation of components.\n    *   **Transportation:** Shipping of raw materials, components, and finished products globally. While transportation per device is relatively small, it is still a contributing factor.\n    *   **Use Phase:** Electricity consumption for charging the device over its estimated lifespan (assumed to be 3-4 years with daily charging). The emissions depend on the electricity grid's carbon intensity.\n    *   **End-of-Life:** Collection, recycling, and disposal of the device. Recycling can offset some emissions, while landfilling or incineration contributes to emissions.\n\n2.  **Material and Manufacturing Dominance:**  Studies and Apple's own environmental reports consistently show that the **production phase (raw materials and manufacturing) is the most significant contributor to the carbon footprint of smartphones**, accounting for approximately 75-85% of the total emissions. This is due to the energy-intensive processes involved in extracting and processing raw materials and manufacturing complex components like semiconductors and displays.\n\n3.  **Reference Data:** Apple's Environmental Progress Reports for previous iPhone models (like iPhone 14 Pro Max) indicate a carbon footprint in the range of 70-85 kg CO2e.  Considering potential incremental improvements in manufacturing efficiency and material sourcing for newer models like iPhone 16, we can reasonably estimate a similar or slightly lower footprint.  \n\n4.  **Assumptions and Estimation:**\n    *   We assume the iPhone 16 has a similar material composition and manufacturing complexity to recent high-end iPhones.\n    *   We use a generalized emission factor based on industry averages and reports for electronic components and manufacturing processes.\n    *   The use phase emissions are calculated based on typical daily charging habits and average electricity grid carbon intensity. This is a smaller portion of the total footprint compared to production.\n    *   End-of-life emissions are considered, factoring in current recycling rates for electronics, which can offset some of the initial production emissions but are not enough to drastically reduce the overall footprint.\n\n5.  **Conservative Estimate:** 75 kg CO2e is a reasonable and slightly conservative estimate based on available data and the understanding that production is the dominant phase.  It aligns with reported values for similar products and reflects the complexity and resource intensity of smartphone manufacturing. More precise LCA would require detailed BOM (Bill of Materials) and specific manufacturing data, which are typically proprietary information. However, for an expert estimation based on publicly available information and LCA principles, 75 kg CO2e provides a realistic order of magnitude for the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of an iPhone 16 128GB."

    "product_name": "IPhone 16 512GB",
    "co2e_kg": 85,
    "explanation": "The estimated cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions for an iPhone 16 512GB are approximately 85 kg. This estimation is based on a life cycle analysis approach, considering the following stages and assumptions:\n\n**1. Raw Material Extraction and Processing (Estimated 45% of total emissions):**\n   - Smartphones are complex devices composed of numerous materials, including aluminum, glass, plastics, copper, gold, silver, tin, tantalum, tungsten, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements. The extraction and processing of these materials are energy-intensive and contribute significantly to CO2e emissions.\n   - For an iPhone 16, we assume a similar material composition to recent iPhone models, with increased material demand due to larger storage (512GB, potentially influencing NAND flash memory and related components).  \n   - Emission factors for raw material extraction and processing are based on industry averages and databases like ecoinvent and GaBi for materials like aluminum (around 8-12 kg CO2e/kg), glass (around 1-3 kg CO2e/kg), plastics (around 2-6 kg CO2e/kg), copper (around 4-8 kg CO2e/kg), gold (around 15,000-20,000 kg CO2e/kg), and rare earth elements (highly variable, but generally high due to complex processing).\n   - We assume a total material weight for the iPhone 16 to be around 170-200 grams, with a detailed breakdown into various material categories based on typical smartphone compositions.  The high emission factors of certain materials like gold and rare earth elements, even in small quantities, contribute substantially to this stage's footprint.\n\n**2. Manufacturing (Estimated 35% of total emissions):**\n   - This stage includes component manufacturing (semiconductors, displays, batteries, PCBs, etc.), assembly, and packaging. Manufacturing processes are energy-intensive, particularly semiconductor fabrication and display production, which require cleanrooms and specialized equipment.\n   -  Asia, particularly China, is the primary manufacturing location for iPhones. The energy mix in these regions often relies on fossil fuels, contributing to higher emission factors for electricity consumption in manufacturing.\n   -  We consider the complexity of the iPhone 16, assuming advanced components and manufacturing processes similar to high-end smartphones.  The 512GB storage capacity might slightly increase manufacturing complexity and energy use compared to lower storage models.\n   - Emission factors for manufacturing are estimated based on industry data for electronics manufacturing, considering energy consumption per unit of production and regional electricity grid emission factors.\n\n**3. Transportation (Estimated 5% of total emissions):**\n   - This includes transportation of raw materials to manufacturing sites, components between manufacturing facilities, and finished products to consumers globally.\n   -  While global transportation distances are significant, shipping is relatively efficient per unit of weight compared to air freight.  However, the sheer volume of iPhones shipped globally results in a noticeable contribution to emissions.\n   - We assume typical transportation modes (ocean freight for bulk transport, air freight for some components and final product distribution) and distances, using emission factors for different transportation modes (e.g., kg CO2e per tonne-kilometer).\n\n**4. Use Phase (Estimated 15% of total emissions):**\n   - This stage accounts for the electricity consumed during the phone's lifespan for charging.  \n   - We assume an average lifespan of 3 years and daily charging.  The energy consumption per charge is based on typical iPhone battery capacity and charging efficiency. \n   - The emission factor for electricity consumption depends on the regional electricity grid mix where the phone is used.  A global average electricity grid emission factor is used for this estimation, acknowledging regional variations can significantly impact this phase's emissions.  We assume approximately 5 kWh of electricity consumption per year for charging, over a 3-year lifespan.\n\n**5. End-of-Life (Net impact assumed to be close to zero or slightly negative due to recycling credits):**\n   - This stage includes disposal and recycling processes.  Improper disposal in landfills can lead to some emissions, but recycling can recover valuable materials, reducing the need for virgin material extraction and processing, thus providing emission credits.\n   -  We assume a moderate recycling rate, reflecting global averages for electronics recycling.  The benefits of material recovery (especially for metals like aluminum, copper, gold, and rare earth elements) are considered as potential offsets to end-of-life emissions.  However, the complexity and efficiency of rare earth element recycling are still limited, so the net benefit is conservatively estimated.\n\n**Reasoning and Data Sources:**\n\n- This estimation is based on a hybrid approach, combining process-based LCA principles with economic input-output LCA considerations for broader system boundaries.\n- Reference data is drawn from: \n    -  Industry reports and LCA studies on smartphones and consumer electronics (e.g., reports from Apple, Fairphone, and academic studies).\n    -  Emission factor databases (ecoinvent, GaBi) for materials, manufacturing processes, transportation, and electricity generation.\n    -  Scientific literature on material extraction, processing, and recycling.\n    -  Standards and protocols like ISO 14040/14044 for LCA methodology and GHG Protocol for emission accounting.\n-  Due to the lack of specific LCA data for the unreleased iPhone 16 512GB, estimations are based on extrapolations from existing data for similar products and general trends in smartphone design and manufacturing.  The 512GB storage is considered as a factor potentially increasing material and manufacturing intensity compared to base models.\n-  The 85 kg CO2e value is within the typical range reported for smartphones, which can vary from around 50 kg to over 100 kg CO2e depending on the model, lifespan assumptions, and LCA methodology.  This estimate aims to be a reasonable approximation based on current best available data and understanding of smartphone life cycle impacts.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an estimated value based on available data and reasonable assumptions. Actual CO2e emissions may vary depending on specific manufacturing processes, supply chain variations, user behavior, and end-of-life management practices. A more precise LCA would require detailed product-specific data from the manufacturer and supply chain."
