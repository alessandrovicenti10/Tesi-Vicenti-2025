    "co2e_kg": 210,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emission calculation for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is an estimate based on typical life cycle analysis (LCA) data for laptops. \n1. **Weight Estimation:** The device weight is estimated at 1.9 kg based on product specifications and similar models.\n2. **Material Composition (Estimated % of weight):** Laptops typically consist of Electronics (PCBs, ICs, etc.) (~35%), Plastics (~30%), Metals (Aluminum, Steel) (~30%), and Battery (~5%). This yields approximate weights: Electronics (0.665 kg), Plastics (0.57 kg), Metals (0.57 kg - primarily Aluminum), Battery (0.095 kg).\n3. **Emission Factors (Manufacturing - kg CO2e/kg material - estimates):** Common factors are applied: Electronics (100), Plastics (5), Aluminum (15), Steel (2), Li-ion Battery (75). These factors represent the impact of extracting raw materials and manufacturing the components.\n4. **Manufacturing Calculation:** (0.665*100) + (0.57*5) + (0.57*15) + (0.095*75) = 66.5 + 2.85 + 8.55 + 7.125 = ~85 kg CO2e. Assembly adds ~10%, totaling ~93.5 kg CO2e.\n5. **Distribution:** Estimated at 5 kg CO2e per unit for global logistics.\n6. **Use Phase:** Assuming a 4-year lifespan, 4 hours/day usage, 40W average power consumption, and a global average electricity grid factor (0.475 kg CO2e/kWh). Total energy = 0.04 kW * 4 h/day * 365 days/year * 4 years = 233.6 kWh. Use phase emissions = 233.6 kWh * 0.475 kg CO2e/kWh = ~111 kg CO2e.\n7. **End-of-Life:** Estimated at 2 kg CO2e for collection, transport, and basic processing/disposal.\n8. **Total CO2e:** Summing the stages: 93.5 (Manufacturing/Assembly) + 5 (Distribution) + 111 (Use) + 2 (End-of-Life) = ~211.5 kg CO2e. This is rounded to 210 kg CO2e.\n**Disclaimer:** This is an approximation. Actual emissions vary based on specific components, manufacturing locations, energy sources, transportation methods, user behavior, and end-of-life management."

    "co2e_kg": 221,
    "explanation": "The CO2e estimate for a Lenovo 14e Chromebook is calculated based on typical life cycle stages for consumer electronics, using industry averages and assumptions due to the lack of specific model data. Assumptions include a standard weight (approx. 1.5 kg) and material composition for a 14-inch Chromebook. The calculation aggregates estimated emissions from: 1) Manufacturing (~180 kg CO2e): This is the dominant phase, covering raw material extraction, processing, component manufacturing (especially energy-intensive semiconductors, battery, and display production), and final assembly. It assumes a globalized supply chain with components sourced and assembled primarily in Asia. 2) Transportation (~10 kg CO2e): Assumes standard global logistics, including sea freight from manufacturing regions to distribution centers and final delivery. 3) Use Phase (~26 kg CO2e): Based on estimated energy consumption for a Chromebook (assuming 10W average power draw, a 4-year lifespan, 4 hours/day usage) and an average electricity grid carbon intensity (approx. 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh). Chromebooks' energy efficiency typically results in lower use-phase emissions compared to more powerful laptops. 4) End-of-Life (~5 kg CO2e): Includes collection, transportation, and processing for disposal and recycling, assuming average waste management practices and recycling rates for electronics.

    "co2e_kg": 228,
    "explanation": "The CO2e estimate for the Dell Latitude 7390 laptop is calculated based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, considering typical industry data and assumptions for electronics. \n1.  **Manufacturing (including materials extraction and processing):** This phase typically dominates the carbon footprint of laptops, primarily due to energy-intensive processes for semiconductor and display manufacturing, and material production (plastics, metals like aluminum, copper). Based on public reports for similar laptops (e.g., Dell's own PCFs for comparable models, general LCA studies), this phase is estimated to contribute around 190 kg CO2e. This assumes a standard configuration and globalized supply chain.\n2.  **Distribution:** This includes transportation from manufacturing sites (typically Asia) to the point of sale. Assuming standard sea and land freight modes, the contribution is estimated at approximately 10 kg CO2e.\n3.  **Use Phase:** This depends on energy consumption over the product's lifespan and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid. Assuming a 4-year lifespan, typical usage patterns (based on Energy Star TEC values, approx. 14 kWh/year), and a global average electricity grid emission factor (approx. 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh), the use phase contributes roughly 25 kg CO2e (4 years * 14 kWh/year * 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh). This value can vary significantly based on user location and usage intensity.\n4.  **End-of-Life (EoL):** This includes collection, transportation, and treatment (recycling, incineration, landfilling). The net impact is often small compared to other phases, sometimes slightly negative if recycling credits are considered. A conservative estimate of 3 kg CO2e is assumed.\n\n**Total Estimated CO2e:** 190 kg (Manufacturing) + 10 kg (Distribution) + 25 kg (Use) + 3 kg (EoL) = **228 kg CO2e**. \n\n*Disclaimer: This is an estimate based on generic data and assumptions for a typical laptop. Actual emissions can vary based on specific components, manufacturing processes, supply chain logistics, user location, and end-of-life management practices.

    "explanation": "The estimated CO2e emissions for a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen laptop are calculated using a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach, considering standard emission factors and typical usage patterns. The calculation encompasses four main phases:\n\n1.  **Manufacturing (Production):** This phase typically dominates the carbon footprint of electronics. It includes raw material extraction (metals like magnesium, copper; semiconductors like silicon; materials like carbon fiber composite, plastics, glass), component manufacturing (CPU, SSD, RAM, display, battery, PCB), and final assembly. Given the laptop's lightweight nature (approx. 1.1 kg) and premium materials (carbon fiber, magnesium alloy), we estimate this phase contributes around 160 kg CO2e. While lightweight, the specific materials and complex components like the CPU/SSD have significant embodied energy.\n\n2.  **Distribution:** This covers transportation from manufacturing sites (likely Asia) to the end consumer globally. Assuming a mix of sea, air, and land freight, this phase is estimated to contribute approximately 15 kg CO2e.\n\n3.  **Use Phase:** This depends heavily on user behavior and the electricity grid mix. Assuming a 4-year lifespan, 5 hours of use per day, an average power consumption of 30W, and a global average electricity emission factor (approx. 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh), the use phase contributes roughly 100 kg CO2e (4 years * 365 days/year * 5 hours/day * 0.03 kW * 0.45 kg CO2e/kWh). This value is highly variable based on location and usage intensity.\n\n4.  **End-of-Life (EoL):** This includes disposal, collection, and recycling or landfilling processes. The impact is generally smaller compared to other phases and depends on local waste management practices. We estimate this phase contributes around 5 kg CO2e.\n\n**Total Estimated CO2e:** 160 (Mfg) + 15 (Dist) + 100 (Use) + 5 (EoL) = 280 kg CO2e.\n\nThis estimate relies on industry averages and publicly available data for similar devices, as specific supply chain and manufacturing process data for this exact model are proprietary. Actual emissions can vary based on specific components, manufacturing locations, transportation methods, user location (electricity grid), usage patterns, and end-of-life handling."

    "explanation": "The CO2e estimate for a Thinkpad L490 laptop is derived from publicly available Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data and Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) reports for comparable notebook computers. A precise calculation requires specific manufacturing, supply chain, and usage data from the manufacturer (Lenovo), which is not provided. This estimate encompasses the major life cycle stages: 1) Manufacturing: Includes raw material extraction (plastics, metals, silicon), component production (CPU, SSD, RAM, display, battery), and assembly. This stage typically accounts for the largest share of emissions (~70-80%). 2) Distribution: Transportation from factory to consumer. 3) Use Phase: Assumes typical electricity consumption over a standard lifespan (e.g., 4 years), heavily influenced by user behavior and local electricity grid mix. 4) End-of-Life: Includes collection, transportation, and processing for disposal or recycling. Based on reports for similar 14-inch business laptops (including other ThinkPad models) which often range from 260 kg to 340 kg CO2e, a value of 300 kg CO2e is a reasonable estimate for the Thinkpad L490 (approx. 1.69 kg weight). Key emission drivers are the energy-intensive manufacturing of semiconductors, the display panel, and the battery, along with the processing of raw materials."

It includes raw material extraction (like aluminum for the chassis, silicon for chips, lithium/cobalt for the battery), processing, component manufacturing (CPU, RAM, SSD, display, battery), and final assembly. Based on publicly available LCA data for similar laptops, including Microsoft's own Product Environmental Reports (which report 241 kg CO2e for production and transport of the 15\" AMD model), this phase is estimated to contribute the most significant portion.\n2.  **Distribution:** Transport from manufacturing facilities to the end customer. This is often included within manufacturing estimates in company reports and is relatively small compared to manufacturing itself.\n3.  **Use:** This depends on the laptop's power consumption, usage patterns (hours/day), assumed lifetime (typically 3-5 years), and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid used for charging. Using Microsoft's estimate for 4 years of typical use (based on ENERGY STAR methodology in the US), this phase contributes approximately 46 kg CO2e.\n4.  **End-of-Life:** This includes collection, transportation, and processing (recycling, incineration, landfill). The net impact is usually small, sometimes slightly negative if recycling credits are considered. Microsoft estimates this at around 3 kg CO2e.\n\nSumming the estimated impacts across the lifecycle (using Microsoft's specific data for the Surface Laptop 4 15\" as a primary reference: ~241 kg for production/transport + ~46 kg for use + ~3 kg for EoL) results in a total estimate of approximately 290 kg CO2e. This value is an estimate based on typical emission factors and publicly available data for this product category."
