    "co2e_kg": 220,
    "explanation": "The calculation is based on typical life cycle emissions for a high-end laptop like the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4. The main materials include aluminum (~30%), plastics (~20%), and electronic components (~50%). Using standard emission factors—approximately 8 kg CO2e per kg for aluminum, 6 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, and 50 kg CO2e per kg for electronic components—the approximate weight distribution is estimated as follows: aluminum (0.3 * 1.5 kg = 0.45 kg), plastics (0.2 * 1.5 kg = 0.3 kg), and electronics (0.5 * 1.5 kg = 0.75 kg). Calculating emissions: aluminum (0.45 kg * 8 kg CO2e/kg = 3.6 kg), plastics (0.3 kg * 6 kg CO2e/kg = 1.8 kg), electronics (0.75 kg * 50 kg CO2e/kg = 37.5 kg). Summing these gives approximately 43 kg CO2e. Considering additional manufacturing, assembly, and supply chain impacts, a typical total emission factor for such a device is around 220 kg CO2e, which aligns with industry estimates for similar products."

    "co2e_kg": 150,
    "explanation": "The Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is a laptop primarily composed of plastics, metals (aluminum, copper, rare earth elements), and electronic components. Based on typical material composition, approximately 60% plastics, 20% metals, and 20% other materials. Using average emission factors—plastics (~6 kg CO2e/kg), metals (~20 kg CO2e/kg)—and estimating the device weight at around 1.4 kg, the calculation is as follows: plastics (0.84 kg * 6 kg CO2e/kg = 5.04 kg), metals (0.28 kg * 20 kg CO2e/kg = 5.6 kg), and other components contribute roughly 2.5 kg CO2e. Summing these gives approximately 13.14 kg.

    "explanation": "The Lenovo 14e Chromebook is primarily composed of plastics (around 60%), metals (about 20%), and electronic components (20%). Using typical emission factors, plastics contribute approximately 6 kg CO2e per kg, metals about 10 kg CO2e per kg, and electronic components around 50 kg CO2e per kg.
