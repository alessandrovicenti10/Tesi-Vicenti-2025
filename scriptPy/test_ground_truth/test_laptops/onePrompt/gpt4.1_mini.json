    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "The MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) is a high-end laptop primarily composed of aluminum (for the chassis), various plastics, glass (for the screen), and electronic components including silicon chips, batteries, and circuit boards. Typical material composition estimates for laptops are approximately 30% aluminum, 20% plastics, 15% glass, 25% electronic components (including silicon and metals like copper, gold, and rare earths), and 10% battery materials. The weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro is around 1.6 kg. Using common emission factors: aluminum production emits about 12 kg CO2e per kg, plastics about 6 kg CO2e per kg, glass about 1.5 kg CO2e per kg, electronic components about 50 kg CO2e per kg (due to complex manufacturing and rare materials), and lithium-ion batteries about 150 kg CO2e per kg. Calculating weighted emissions: (0.48 kg Al * 12) + (0.32 kg plastics * 6) + (0.24 kg glass * 1.5) + (0.4 kg electronics * 50) + (0.16 kg battery * 150) = 5.76 + 1.92 + 0.36 + 20 + 24 = 52.04 kg CO2e. However, this only accounts for raw material production. Including manufacturing, assembly, transportation, and use phase emissions (which are significant for electronics), the total life cycle emissions for a MacBook Pro are commonly estimated around 200 kg CO2e. This figure aligns with published LCA studies for similar laptops, reflecting the full cradle-to-gate and use phase emissions."

    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "The MacBook Pro 13-inch M1 (2020) 256GB SSD is a laptop computer with an estimated weight of approximately 1.4 kg. Typical material composition for laptops includes aluminum (for the casing, about 30-40%), plastics (about 20-30%), glass (screen, about 10-15%), and various electronic components including circuit boards, batteries, and SSD storage. Using common emission factors: aluminum production emits roughly 12-17 kg CO2e per kg, plastics around 2-6 kg CO2e per kg, glass about 1-2 kg CO2e per kg, and electronics components average around 50-60 kg CO2e per kg due to complex manufacturing and rare materials. Assuming the laptop is approximately 1.4 kg with 40% aluminum (0.56 kg), 25% plastics (0.35 kg), 15% glass (0.21 kg), and 20% electronics (0.28 kg), the weighted emissions are: aluminum 0.56 kg * 15 kg CO2e/kg = 8.4 kg, plastics 0.35 kg * 4 kg CO2e/kg = 1.4 kg, glass 0.21 kg * 1.5 kg CO2e/kg = 0.315 kg, electronics 0.28 kg * 55 kg CO2e/kg = 15.4 kg. Summing these gives approximately 25.5 kg CO2e for materials. However, the majority of laptop CO2e emissions come from manufacturing processes, assembly, and supply chain impacts, which can be 5-8 times the material emissions. Including these factors, the total embodied carbon footprint is estimated around 200 kg CO2e. This aligns with published LCA studies for similar laptops, which report embodied emissions in the range of 150-250 kg CO2e per unit."

    "co2e_kg": 150,
    "explanation": "The Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is a laptop computer, typically weighing around 1.3 to 1.5 kg. For laptops, the life cycle CO2e emissions are dominated by material production, manufacturing, and use phase energy consumption. Assuming a weight of 1.4 kg, the material composition is roughly: aluminum (20%), plastics (30%), glass (10%), electronic components including PCBs and batteries (40%). Using common emission factors: aluminum ~12 kg CO2e/kg, plastics ~6 kg CO2e/kg, glass ~1.5 kg CO2e/kg, electronics ~50 kg CO2e/kg (due to complex manufacturing). Calculating material emissions: (0.28 kg Al * 12) + (0.42 kg plastics * 6) + (0.14 kg glass * 1.5) + (0.56 kg electronics * 50) = 3.36 + 2.52 + 0.21 + 28 = 34.09 kg CO2e. The manufacturing process adds approximately 1.5 times the material emissions, totaling ~85 kg CO2e. The use phase, assuming 5 years of average use with 15 kWh/year electricity consumption and average grid emission factor of 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh, adds 30 kg CO2e. End-of-life and transport add roughly 10-15 kg CO2e. Summing all phases: 85 + 30 + 15 = 130 kg CO2e. Considering variability and conservative estimates, the total life cycle CO2e emissions for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is approximately 150 kg CO2e."

    "explanation": "The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (Metal, 15 inch) is a high-end laptop primarily composed of aluminum, plastics, glass, and electronic components. Typical laptops of this size and category have a carbon footprint ranging from 150 to 250 kg CO2e over their life cycle, with the majority of emissions arising from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and assembly. Assuming the laptop weighs approximately 1.5 kg, with about 40% aluminum (metal casing), 30% plastics, 15% glass (screen), and 15% electronic components (circuit boards, battery), the emission factors are roughly: aluminum ~12 kg CO2e/kg, plastics ~6 kg CO2e/kg, glass ~1.5 kg CO2e/kg, and electronics ~50 kg CO2e/kg. Calculating weighted emissions: (0.6 kg Al * 12) + (0.45 kg plastics * 6) + (0.225 kg glass * 1.5) + (0.225 kg electronics * 50) = 7.2 + 2.7 + 0.34 + 11.25 = 21.49 kg CO2e for materials.
