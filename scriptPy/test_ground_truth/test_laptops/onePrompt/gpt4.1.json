    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 210,
    "explanation": "The MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) is a high-end laptop. Based on Apple's own life cycle assessments for similar models (e.g., the 2023 MacBook Pro 14-inch with M2/3 chips), the total cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions are typically in the range of 200-250 kg CO2e per unit. The main contributors are: aluminum (30-40%), electronics (40-50%), battery (5-10%), and other materials (plastics, glass, etc.). Manufacturing is the largest phase, followed by use (assuming average global electricity mix), transport, and end-of-life. Using the most common emission factors for these materials and processes, and assuming the M4 chip and 512GB storage do not significantly alter the overall material composition or energy use compared to previous models, a reasonable estimate is 210 kg CO2e per unit."

    "co2e_kg": 210,
    "explanation": "The Macbook Pro 13-inch M1 (2020) 256GB SSD is a laptop computer. According to Apple's own environmental reports and industry LCA data, the typical life cycle CO2e emissions for a 13-inch Macbook Pro of this configuration are approximately 210 kg CO2e. This includes raw material extraction (aluminum, plastics, glass, electronics), manufacturing (assembly, component production), transportation, use phase (energy consumption over average lifespan), and end-of-life processing. The majority of emissions (about 70-80%) come from materials and manufacturing, with aluminum casing and electronics (mainboard, battery, display) being the largest contributors. Emission factors used are: aluminum (~10-16 kg CO2e/kg), electronics (~20-30 kg CO2e/kg), plastics (~2-4 kg CO2e/kg), and average global electricity mix for use phase. This estimate aligns with published LCA data for similar laptops."

    "co2e_kg": 320,
    "explanation": "The Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is a laptop computer, typically weighing around 1.9 kg. The average material composition for laptops is approximately 40% aluminum (or magnesium alloy), 30% plastics, 15% glass, 10% electronics (PCBs, chips), and 5% other materials. Using common emission factors: aluminum (10 kg CO2e/kg), plastics (2.5 kg CO2e/kg), glass (1.5 kg CO2e/kg), electronics (20 kg CO2e/kg). Calculating per material: aluminum (0.76 kg x 10 = 7.6 kg CO2e), plastics (0.57 kg x 2.5 = 1.43 kg CO2e), glass (0.285 kg x 1.5 = 0.43 kg CO2e), electronics (0.19 kg x 20 = 3.8 kg CO2e), others (0.095 kg x 2 = 0.19 kg CO2e). Summing these gives about 13.45 kg CO2e for materials. However, the full LCA for a laptop (including manufacturing, assembly, and upstream processes) is typically 200–400 kg CO2e per unit, based on industry averages (e.g., Apple, Dell, Lenovo LCA reports). Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 is 320 kg CO2e, reflecting the full cradle-to-gate emissions."

    "co2e_kg": 180,
    "explanation": "The Lenovo 14e Chromebook is a typical mid-range laptop, weighing approximately 1.45 kg. Standard material composition for laptops is roughly 40% aluminum (case), 30% plastics (keyboard, casing), 15% glass (screen), 10% electronics (circuit boards, chips), and 5% battery. Emission factors (kg CO2e/kg material) are: aluminum (10), plastics (3), glass (1.5), electronics (25), battery (12). Calculating per component: aluminum (0.58 kg x 10 = 5.8), plastics (0.44 kg x 3 = 1.32), glass (0.22 kg x 1.5 = 0.33), electronics (0.145 kg x 25 = 3.63), battery (0.0725 kg x 12 = 0.87). Total for materials: ~12 kg CO2e. However, manufacturing energy, assembly, and upstream supply chain emissions are significant for electronics, typically 10-15x the material emissions. Industry LCA data (e.g., Apple, Dell) for similar Chromebooks/laptops show total cradle-to-gate emissions of 150-200 kg CO2e per device. Therefore, the estimated total CO2e for the Lenovo 14e Chromebook is 180 kg, reflecting both material and manufacturing emissions."

    "co2e_kg": 320,
    "explanation": "The Dell XPS 13 9370 is a lightweight ultrabook with an approximate weight of 1.2 kg. Typical material composition for laptops is about 40% aluminum, 30% plastics, 15% glass, 10% electronics (PCBs, chips), and 5% other materials. Emission factors (cradle-to-gate) are roughly: aluminum 10 kg CO2e/kg, plastics 2.5 kg CO2e/kg, glass 1.5 kg CO2e/kg, electronics 30 kg CO2e/kg. Using these, the material emissions are estimated at ~15 kg CO2e. However, the majority of a laptop's embodied emissions come from semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, which is energy-intensive. Industry LCA studies (e.g., Apple, Dell, and academic sources) report total embodied emissions for similar ultrabooks in the range of 250–350 kg CO2e. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the Dell XPS 13 9370 is 320 kg CO2e, which includes materials, manufacturing, and assembly, but excludes use phase and end-of-life."

    "explanation": "The Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen is an ultrabook laptop, typically weighing around 1.1-1.2 kg. For laptops, the embodied CO2e emissions are mainly from materials (aluminum/magnesium chassis, plastics, glass, lithium-ion battery, and electronic components), manufacturing, and assembly. Based on published LCA data for similar ultrabooks, the average cradle-to-gate CO2e is about 250-350 kg per unit. The main contributors are electronics (50-60%), aluminum/magnesium (15-20%), battery (10-15%), and display (10-15%). Using emission factors (e.g., 10-15 kg CO2e/kg for electronics, 8-12 kg CO2e/kg for aluminum, 5-8 kg CO2e/kg for plastics), and assuming typical material breakdown (electronics 0.5 kg, aluminum 0.4 kg, plastics 0.2 kg, battery 0.1 kg, glass 0.1 kg), the total is approximately 320 kg CO2e.

    "explanation": "The Thinkpad L490 is a business laptop with an estimated weight of around 1.7 kg. Typical material composition for laptops is approximately 40% aluminum and steel (0.68 kg), 25% plastics (0.43 kg), 20% glass and electronics (0.34 kg), and 15% other materials (0.25 kg). Using common emission factors: aluminum/steel ~10 kg CO2e/kg, plastics ~3 kg CO2e/kg, electronics (including PCB, battery, display) ~30 kg CO2e/kg, and others ~2 kg CO2e/kg. Calculating: (0.68*10) + (0.43*3) + (0.34*30) + (0.25*2) = 6.8 + 1.29 + 10.2 + 0.5 = 18.79 kg CO2e for materials. However, manufacturing, assembly, and upstream processes typically add 10-15x the material emissions for electronics, resulting in a total embodied carbon of approximately 300-350 kg CO2e per laptop. This aligns with published LCA data for similar laptops (e.g., Lenovo, Dell, Apple). Therefore, the estimated total CO2e emissions for the Thinkpad L490 is 320 kg."

Manufacturing energy and assembly add significant emissions, and upstream data from Ecoinvent and Apple/Microsoft LCA reports suggest total embodied emissions for similar devices are 100–150 kg CO2e. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the Surface Pro 7 is 120 kg CO2e, including materials, manufacturing, and assembly."

    "explanation": "The iPhone 16 512GB is a high-end smartphone. Based on typical LCA data for smartphones, the majority of emissions come from material extraction, component manufacturing (especially semiconductors, display, and battery), assembly, and transportation. For a 512GB model, emissions are higher due to increased memory and storage. Apple’s own environmental reports for recent iPhones (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro 512GB) estimate cradle-to-grave emissions at around 70-80 kg CO2e per device. The main material breakdown is approximately: aluminum (20%), steel (15%), glass (15%), plastics (10%), battery (15%), electronics (25%). Using common emission factors (e.g., aluminum: ~10 kg CO2e/kg, steel: ~2 kg CO2e/kg, battery: ~100 kg CO2e/kWh, electronics: ~30-50 kg CO2e/kg), and considering the device weight (~200g), the total is estimated at 75 kg CO2e. This includes production, transport, use (over 3-4 years), and end-of-life processing."
