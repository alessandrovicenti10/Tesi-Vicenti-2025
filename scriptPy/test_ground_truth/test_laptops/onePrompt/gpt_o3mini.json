    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 300,
    "explanation": "This estimate is derived by applying typical material breakdowns and common emission factors found in life cycle assessments for high‐end laptops. For example, the MacBook Pro’s chassis is largely aluminum (with emission factors around 11–12 kg CO2e/kg), while plastics, rare metals, and other components such as the battery and display contribute additional emissions (using factors in the range of 4–6 kg CO2e/kg or higher for energy‐intensive processing). Factoring in the manufacturing and assembly energy demands that are characteristic of premium computing devices, the overall production phase emissions for a product with these specifications are estimated to be on the order of 300 kg CO2e. This value aligns with published LCA studies for similar products, though actual numbers may vary with changes in design, material sourcing, and production methods."

    "product_name": "Macbook Pro 13-inch M1 (2020) 256GB SSD",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "We based our estimate on a typical LCA breakdown for a premium laptop. A MacBook Pro is largely made up of light‐weight metals (about 60% aluminum), with smaller portions of plastics (around 10%), battery components (roughly 15%) and electronics such as printed circuit boards and glass (the remaining 15%). Using common emission factors—for example, roughly 10 kg CO2e per kg for primary aluminum, around 6 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, approximately 150 kg CO2e per kg for lithium‐ion battery components, and near 20 kg CO2e per kg for printed circuit materials—and then including additional process and assembly emissions typical for electronics, we arrive at an embodied carbon value in the order of 200 kg CO2e. Note that this cradle‐to‐gate estimate is an approximation and actual values may vary with specific manufacturing processes, supply chain details, and recycling content."

    "product_name": "Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "This estimate is derived from a simplified life cycle analysis for a mid‐range laptop in the Computers category. We assume that the Lenovo YOGA Chromebook C630 weighs roughly 1.5 kg and is composed roughly of metals (about 25%), plastics (35%), glass (5%) and high‐impact electronic components such as circuit boards (20%) along with other minor materials (15%). Using typical emission factors—for example, around 15–20 kg CO2e per kg for metals; 6 kg CO2e per kg for plastics; and much higher factors (in the order of 100–150 kg CO2e per kg) for printed circuit boards—we first estimate that the raw material and manufacturing extraction contributes on the order of 55–60 kg CO2e. However, when one accounts for energy use in manufacturing, assembly, transportation and other supply chain processes, the embedded or “embodied” emissions can be roughly tripled. This gives an estimate of approximately 170 kg CO2e for the production phase. In addition, assuming modest usage consumption (e.g., a low power draw typical of a Chromebook used daily over a period of several years) adds roughly 20–30 kg CO2e to the life cycle impact. Thus, the total life cycle CO2e for this product is estimated to be about 200 kg. Note that this is a generalized estimation based on common material percentages and emission factors, and actual values may differ based on specific design, manufacturing processes and usage patterns."

    "product_name": "Lenovo 14e Chromebook",
    "co2e_kg": 100,
    "explanation": "This estimate is based on a simplified cradle‐to‐gate life cycle analysis of a typical laptop in the Computers category. We assume that a Lenovo 14e Chromebook weighs about 1.5 kg and that its materials can be roughly broken down as follows: about 40% metal, 30% plastic, 15% glass (for the display) and 15% electronic components (including the PCB and lithium‐ion battery). Using typical emission factors—roughly 10 kg CO2e per kg for metals, 6 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, around 1–1.1 kg CO2e per kg for glass, and considerably higher emission intensities (on the order of 150–200 kg CO2e per kg) for electronics—and summing the material contributions gives an approximate value of 50 kg CO2e from the raw materials. Considering that the manufacturing, assembly and energy‐intensive processing steps generally add a similar magnitude of emissions, we double the material estimate. Thus, our back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation yields around 100 kg CO2e for the production of a Lenovo 14e Chromebook. This is a rough, order‐of‐magnitude estimate based on typical assumptions and common emission factors used in LCA studies for similar devices."

    "product_name": "Dell XPS 13 9370",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "This estimate is derived by breaking down the laptop’s typical material composition and applying common emission factors. For example, an ultraportable like the Dell XPS 13 9370 is assumed to have a structure dominated by metals (such as aluminum), plastics, and electronic components. Aluminum production typically has a high CO2e footprint (around 10–11 kg CO2e per kg), while plastics and circuit board manufacturing contribute significant emissions as well. By assuming a realistic percentage split of materials – with metals, polymers, and electronic components each representing a substantial share of the overall mass – and by including energy use during manufacturing, assembly, transportation, and end-of-life handling, the overall embodied carbon is estimated to be on the order of 200 kg CO2e. This value represents an aggregated life cycle impact (from raw material extraction to manufacturing) using average industry emission factors."

    "product_name": "Dell Latitude 7390",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "To arrive at the estimate, we first assumed that a typical business‐laptop like the Dell Latitude 7390 weighs around 1.5 kg and is made up of a mixture of materials whose production emissions can be reasonably approximated by common LCA data. For example, one may assume roughly 40% of the weight is metals (e.g., aluminum or steel), 30% plastics, 20% electronics (circuit boards and associated components) and 10% batteries/displays. Using typical emission factors – for instance, around 7–10 kg CO2e per kg for metals, 3–5 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, and substantially higher factors for the energy‐intensive production of electronic circuit boards and battery components (often in the order of 100 kg CO2e/kg in localized “hot spots” of production) – the contributions from these material fractions combine with additional manufacturing overhead (assembly, testing, and logistics) to yield an overall cradle‐to‐gate footprint in the range of 200 kg CO2e. This estimate is in line with published LCA studies for similar computing devices and reflects common assumptions used when detailed product‐specific data are not available."

    "product_name": "Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen",
    "co2e_kg": 250,
    "explanation": "This estimate is based on a simplified LCA approach common in the electronics industry. For a laptop like the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen, one can assume a material mix roughly consisting of around 30% aluminum (for the chassis and some structural parts), 40% plastics (for internal housings and components), 20% electronic components (printed circuit boards, solder, semiconductors) and 10% other metals and rare elements (including battery materials). Typical emission factors might range from 8–10 kg CO2e per kg for metals such as aluminum, about 6–8 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, and significantly higher factors (sometimes approaching or exceeding 100 kg CO2e/kg) for the energy‐intensive production of electronics. When the emissions from raw material extraction, manufacturing, assembly, distribution, use over the product’s lifetime, and eventual end‐of‐life treatment are summed, a typical modern ultrabook reaches a total carbon footprint in the vicinity of 250 kg CO2e. This value reflects a common benchmark used for similar high-performance computing devices."

    "product_name": "Thinkpad L490",
    "co2e_kg": 245,
    "explanation": "The estimate is based on typical LCA studies for business laptops. For a model like the Thinkpad L490, the production phase (which includes raw material extraction, component manufacturing, assembly, and transport) is broken down approximately as follows: around 30% of emissions are associated with metal components (for instance, aluminum and steel used in the chassis), 25% with plastics, 15% with battery production, 20% with the fabrication of electronic components (such as printed circuit boards and chips), and the remaining 10% with assembly and logistics. Common emission factors for metals (≈6 kg CO2e per kg), plastics (≈5 kg CO2e per kg), and batteries (which are energy intensive) were used in the estimation. Summing these contributions yields an approximate total of 245 kg of CO2e for the production and associated processes. This figure is an approximation using typical material percentage distributions and average industry emission factors, and actual values may vary based on specific manufacturing practices and regional energy mixes."

    "product_name": "Microsoft Surface Pro 7",
    "co2e_kg": 140,
    "explanation": "This estimate follows a simplified material‐based life cycle analysis for a typical mid‐range portable computer like the Surface Pro 7. In our assumptions, we consider that its total mass is roughly 1 kg and that its components can be roughly broken down as follows: about 45–50% printed circuit board and semiconductor components (which tend to have high embodied emissions, on the order of ~100 kg CO2e per kg), around 20% display (with emission factors around 80–100 kg CO2e per kg), roughly 15% metal chassis (using aluminum or similar metals with factors near 30 kg CO2e per kg), 10% battery material (for lithium‐ion cells which can be about 200 kg CO2e per kg), and the remaining 10% being plastics or miscellaneous parts (with lower factors, roughly 50 kg CO2e per kg). Multiplying these percentages by their respective emission factors and summing yields a subtotal in the 90–100 kg CO2e range for the raw materials. Factoring in additional energy use for processing, assembly and testing—typically adding on the order of 30–50%—we arrive at an overall estimate of approximately 140 kg CO2e. Please note that this number is a rough approximation based on common assumptions about component shares and generic emission factors, and actual values can vary with production processes, supply chain conditions, and specific material choices."

    "product_name": "Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (Metal, 15 inch)",
    "co2e_kg": 240,
    "explanation": "Based on a back‐of‐the‐envelope life cycle assessment for a premium laptop such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (15 inch, metal), we first estimated a typical product weight of about 1.5 kg. We then assumed a material breakdown roughly as follows: about 40% metal (primarily aluminum for the chassis), 30% plastics and composites, 20% printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and 10% miscellaneous materials. Using common emission factors from the literature – for instance, around 15 kg CO2e per kg for processed metals, roughly 6 kg CO2e per kg for plastics, and an elevated factor of about 25 kg CO2e per kg for high‐tech components like PCBs – the direct material-related emissions would appear to sum to a few tens of kilograms. However, additional energy use and process inefficiencies in material processing, component manufacturing, assembly, and testing (all of which are significant in the electronics manufacturing sector) lead to a much higher overall cradle-to-gate footprint. Aggregating these factors, many published studies on laptop LCAs converge on a value on the order of 200–250 kg CO2e. In our estimate, we arrived at approximately 240 kg CO2e as a representative figure for the product’s manufacturing footprint."

    "product_name": "iPhone 16 128GB",
    "co2e_kg": 75,
    "explanation": "This estimate is derived from a simplified LCA breakdown of a typical smartphone. In our calculation we assumed that the smartphone’s life cycle can be divided roughly into three blocks: materials extraction and processing, component manufacturing and assembly, and logistics/packaging/end‐of‐life. The display (often a high-tech OLED or similar panel) and battery (with its energy–intensive lithium–ion chemistry) tend to have particularly high embodied emissions, roughly contributing 30% and 20% of total emissions, respectively. The remaining materials such as metal chassis, printed circuit boards, and plastics generally contribute another 30% when factoring in mining and refining, while assembly, packaging, and transport processes contribute the remaining 20%. Using common emission factors (for example, 15–25 kg CO2e per kg of processed material or per unit energy intensity in manufacturing processes), the aggregated GHG emissions through the product’s entire life cycle comes out to be approximately 75 kg CO2e for a device of this specification (a 128GB smartphone such as the iPhone 16). Note that this is a simplified, rule‐of–thumb calculation intended for estimation purposes."

    "product_name": "IPhone 16 512GB",
    "co2e_kg": 75,
    "explanation": "This estimate uses typical LCA assumptions for smartphones. The analysis assumes that a modern smartphone like an iPhone 16 512GB is made up of a mix of materials – metals (about 35–40%), glass (around 20–25%), plastics (10–15%), and specialized components including batteries and semiconductors (the remainder). Standard LCA studies indicate that the majority of carbon emissions occur during material extraction and manufacturing (roughly 50% of the total), with distribution, use, and end‐of‐life stages accounting for the rest. Based on common emission factors for these processes (and considering that premium smartphones tend to have slightly higher impacts due to robust build quality and larger battery capacities), the overall cradle‐to‐grave estimate is around 70–80 kg of CO2e. Here, it has been rounded to 75 kg CO2e. Note that actual figures can vary depending on factors such as supply chain specifics and energy sources."
