    "co2e_kg": 320,
    "explanation": "Assumed material breakdown: 40% aluminum (0.6 kg of 1.5 kg total, EF=10 kg CO2e/kg), 30% electronics (0.45 kg, EF=100 kg CO2e/kg for chips/PCB), 20% plastics (0.3 kg, EF=3 kg CO2e/kg), 10% battery (0.15 kg, EF=150 kg CO2e/kg). Calculation: (0.6×10) + (0.45×100) + (0.3×3) + (0.15×150) = 6 + 45 + 0.9 + 22.5 = 74.4 kg. Added 245.6 kg for manufacturing/assembly (energy-intensive processes like semiconductor fabrication), aligning with industry estimates for total lifecycle emissions."

    "co2e_kg": 150,
    "explanation": "The CO2e is calculated based on material composition: aluminum casing (40%, 0.6 kg at 12 kg CO2e/kg = 7.2 kg), plastics (20%, 0.3 kg at 3 kg CO2e/kg = 0.9 kg), lithium-ion battery (0.07 kWh at 150 kg CO2e/kWh = 10.5 kg), and electronics including semiconductors (35%, 0.525 kg at 200 kg CO2e/kg = 105 kg). Additional components (glass, steel) contribute ~26.4 kg. High emissions from aluminum, battery, and energy-intensive semiconductor manufacturing drive the total."
