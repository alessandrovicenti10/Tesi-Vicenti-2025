    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 250,
    "explanation": "Based on a simplified cradle‐to‐gate LCA for a premium laptop like the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4, we estimated total emissions of about 250 kg CO2e. This rough figure comes from assuming a material mix typical of such devices – around 70% aluminum (used for the enclosure and internal structure), 10% high‐performance plastics and polymers, 10% glass and ceramics (for the display and touch surfaces), and 10% of other metals and composites (including the processor, battery, and circuit boards). For each material, standard emission factors were applied (for example, aluminum production is energy intensive, with emission factors on the order of 10–16 kg CO2e/kg, while plastics and glass are lower). In addition, the manufacturing, assembly, testing, and transportation stages (from raw material extraction through final assembly and distribution) contribute additional emissions. Assuming roughly 40–50% of the total CO2e comes from material production, about 30–40% from manufacturing and assembly, and the remaining 10–20% from logistics and end‐of‐life considerations, the overall cradle‐to‐gate estimate settles around 250 kg CO2e. It is important to note that this is an approximation based on common emission factors and standard material breakdowns observed in similar high-tech computers."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 230,
    "explanation": "We estimated the life‐cycle CO2e emissions of the MacBook Pro by adopting a simplified material breakdown and applying common emission factors. In our approach we assumed that a high‐performance laptop of about 1.6 kg is made up roughly of 50% aluminum (used for its casing), 20% high‐density printed circuit board and other electronics (where energy‐intensive semiconductor processes play a role), 15% lithium‐based battery (with its high upstream energy use) and 15% plastics and minor metals. For aluminum we used an emission factor on the order of 16–20 kg CO2e per kg, for printed circuit assemblies a much higher factor (around 200 kg CO2e per kg) and for lithium battery materials roughly 150 kg CO2e per kg, with plastics contributing a lower factor (around 6 kg CO2e per kg). When the weighted impacts of these components are aggregated the cradle‐to‐gate emissions come to approximately 230 kg CO2e. Note that this is a rough estimate based on average material percentages and emission factors typical in LCA studies of computers, and actual values may vary with the specific design, production processes and energy mix used."

    "co2e_kg": 230,
    "explanation": "This estimate is derived by approximating the full life‐cycle emissions of a high‐end laptop such as the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB. First, we assume that the finished device weighs roughly 1.5–2.0 kg and is built predominantly from aluminum (about 65–70% by weight), with the remainder comprising high‐performance circuit boards, plastics, and other specialty materials. For aluminum, typical emission factors in primary production are on the order of 12–16 kg CO2e per kg, while plastics and other electronics components have lower factors (in the range of 3–6 kg CO2e per kg); however, these material factors capture only the raw material stage. When we account for the energy‐intensive processes involved in semiconductor fabrication, precision machining (e.g., for the unibody structure), assembly in clean room environments, testing, and even the transportation and distribution stages, the manufacturing phase itself becomes a significant contributor. Combining these stages using common industry assumptions—roughly 60% of the footprint coming from material production and 40% from processing, assembly, and distribution—the final aggregated value comes out in the vicinity of 230 kg CO2e. This estimate is a typical mid‐range value for a premium but resource‐efficient laptop product."
