    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 275.0,
    "explanation": "Based on the LCA methodology, the 250 kg CO2e figure provided already aggregates major energy‐intensive steps including raw material extraction/processing (such as aluminum smelting), machining, and final precision assembly. In line with the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 methods, additional stages (transportation/distribution and end‐of‐life disposal) are typically estimated to add roughly 10% to the cradle‐to‐gate emissions. Applying an approximate increment of 25 kg CO2e (10% of 250 kg) yields a total life cycle footprint of about 275 kg CO2e per finished unit. This approach is consistent with assumptions under PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 using both primary and secondary data to reflect the complete product life cycle."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 275.0,
    "explanation": "The calculation follows a cradle‐to‐grave approach. The provided manufacturing estimate (220 kg CO2e) reflects Scope 1 & 2 emissions from high‐tech production (energy‐intensive aluminum refining, machining, electronics fabrication, etc.) as explained. In addition, using standard LCA methods (ISO 14040/14044) and under the GHG Protocol and PAS 2050, we estimate that upstream processes (material extraction and processing) as well as transportation/distribution and end‐of‐life disposal (all Scope 3) add roughly 25% (~55 kg CO2e) to the product’s footprint. Thus, the total carbon footprint is roughly 275.00 kg CO2e."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB",
    "co2e_kg": 348.0,
    "explanation": "Assuming the finished MacBook Pro weighs roughly 1.6 kg, the manufacturing stage emits about 150 kg CO2e per kilogram of product (1.6 kg × 150 kg CO2e/kg = 240 kg CO2e). In a simplified cradle‐to‐grave approach—as recommended by the GHG Protocol Product Standard and following ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067—we also include emissions from material extraction and processing (estimated at ~30% of the manufacturing emissions), transportation/distribution (~10%), and end‐of‐life disposal (~5%). These additional stages contribute roughly 72 kg, 24 kg, and 12 kg CO2e, respectively. Summing these (240 + 72 + 24 + 12) gives an overall carbon footprint of approximately 348 kg CO2e. This “back‐of‐the‐envelope” calculation uses average emission factors and percentage assumptions common in LCA studies for electronics."
