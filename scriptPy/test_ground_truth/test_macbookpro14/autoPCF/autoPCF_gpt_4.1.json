    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 320.0,
    "explanation": "The total carbon footprint of the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4, 512GB) is estimated at 320 kg CO2e, calculated according to GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067. Manufacturing emissions are 250 kg CO2e (primary and secondary data, including material extraction, processing, and assembly). Transportation and distribution are estimated at 30 kg CO2e (air and sea freight, packaging, last-mile delivery, based on typical electronics supply chains). End-of-life disposal is estimated at 40 kg CO2e (collection, recycling, landfill, and incineration impacts, assuming average global e-waste treatment rates). All emissions are converted to CO2e using 100-year GWP values. The system boundary includes cradle-to-grave stages, as required by the referenced standards."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 410.0,
    "explanation": "Total CO2e is calculated for the full life cycle per GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067. Manufacturing (including material extraction/processing and assembly) is 320 kg CO2e, based on detailed material breakdown and industry emission factors. Transportation/distribution is estimated at 30 kg CO2e (air/sea freight from Asia to global markets, packaging, last-mile delivery), using DEFRA and Ecoinvent data. End-of-life disposal (collection, recycling, landfill) is estimated at 60 kg CO2e, based on typical electronics recycling rates and emissions (Ecoinvent, Apple EPDs). All emissions are converted to CO2e using 100-year GWP values. The total (320 + 30 + 60) = 410 kg CO2e, representing the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB, in line with international LCA and carbon footprinting standards."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB",
    "co2e_kg": 320.0,
    "explanation": "Total CO2e is calculated by summing emissions from material extraction/processing (~130 kg CO2e), manufacturing/assembly (90 kg CO2e), transportation/distribution (~30 kg CO2e, assuming global air/sea freight and regional delivery), and end-of-life disposal (~20 kg CO2e, accounting for recycling and landfill impacts). All values are based on weighted material emission factors, process energy, and typical electronics logistics/disposal data, following GHG Protocol Product Standard (full cradle-to-grave), ISO 14040/14044 (LCA inventory and impact assessment), PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 (carbon footprinting). Emissions are converted to CO2e using standard GWP values and include all relevant direct and indirect sources across the product life cycle."
