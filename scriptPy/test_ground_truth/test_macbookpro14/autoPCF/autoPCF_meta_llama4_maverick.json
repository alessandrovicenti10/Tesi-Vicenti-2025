    "explanation": "The total CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB are calculated following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044 LCA methodology, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. The emissions include material extraction and processing (24.17 kg CO2e), manufacturing (320 kg CO2e), and transportation/distribution (0.32 kg CO2e), totaling 344.49 kg CO2e. End-of-life disposal is considered to potentially offer some CO2e savings, especially through aluminum recycling, but is not directly subtracted in this calculation."
