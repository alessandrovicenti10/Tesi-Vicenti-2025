    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 210.5,
    "explanation": "Following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067, the total CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) were calculated by summing emissions from all life cycle stages within defined system boundaries: material extraction and processing (Scope 3 upstream), manufacturing (Scope 1 & 2), transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream & downstream), and end-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream). Material extraction and processing emissions were estimated using typical emission factors for each material weighted by their mass percentage, with aluminum (60%) contributing the largest share due to energy-intensive bauxite refining and smelting (~60 kg CO2e), glass (15%) (~10 kg CO2e), lithium-ion battery components (10%) (~15 kg CO2e), silicon semiconductors (5%) (~8 kg CO2e), plastics (5%) (~3 kg CO2e), copper (3%) (~2 kg CO2e), and other metals (2%) (~1.5 kg CO2e), totaling approximately 100.5 kg CO2e. Manufacturing emissions are provided as 120 kg CO2e per product, reflecting energy use in assembly and processing. Transportation and distribution emissions were conservatively estimated at 5 kg CO2e, based on typical logistics for electronics products. End-of-life disposal emissions were estimated at 5 kg CO2e, accounting for recycling credits and waste treatment emissions. All greenhouse gases were converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 GWP values. The final aggregated carbon footprint is approximately 210.5 kg CO2e per unit, representing a cradle-to-grave assessment consistent with international LCA and carbon footprint standards."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 240.0,
    "explanation": "Following the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044, the total CO2e includes material extraction and processing, manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life. Material extraction and processing emissions were estimated using typical emission factors per material: aluminum (~12 kg CO2e/kg), glass (~1.5 kg CO2e/kg), plastic (~6 kg CO2e/kg), silicon (~20 kg CO2e/kg), copper (~4 kg CO2e/kg), and other metals (~8 kg CO2e/kg). Weighted by material percentages for a 1 kg product, this totals approximately 120 kg CO2e. Manufacturing emissions are provided as 120 kg CO2e per kg product. Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream & downstream) and end-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) are conservatively estimated at 10% of combined material and manufacturing emissions (~24 kg CO2e). Summing these stages yields a total carbon footprint of approximately 240 kg CO2e per product unit. All emissions converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 GWP values, consistent with PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 requirements."

    "co2e_kg": 320.5,
    "explanation": "Following the GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067, the total CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB were calculated by summing emissions from all life cycle stages within defined system boundaries. Material extraction and processing (Scope 3 upstream) were estimated using emission factors for each material weighted by their mass percentages: aluminum (60%) is highly energy-intensive (~120 kg CO2e), glass (15%) moderate (~15 kg CO2e), lithium-ion battery components (10%) significant (~40 kg CO2e), silicon semiconductors (5%) very energy-intensive (~25 kg CO2e), plastics (5%) moderate (~5 kg CO2e), copper (3%) moderate (~8 kg CO2e), and rare earth elements (2%) energy-intensive (~7 kg CO2e), totaling approximately 220 kg CO2e. Manufacturing emissions (Scope 1 & 2) are provided as 150 kg CO2e, but to avoid double counting with material processing, only the net manufacturing assembly emissions (~30 kg CO2e) were added. Transportation and distribution (Scope 3 upstream & downstream) were estimated at 40 kg CO2e based on typical electronics logistics distances and modes. End-of-life disposal (Scope 3 downstream) emissions were estimated at 10 kg CO2e considering recycling rates and waste treatment impacts. All emissions were converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 GWP values. The final aggregated carbon footprint is approximately 320.5 kg CO2e per unit, reflecting a cradle-to-grave assessment consistent with PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 requirements."
