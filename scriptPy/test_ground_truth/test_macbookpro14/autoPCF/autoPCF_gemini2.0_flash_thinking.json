    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 653.75,
    "explanation": "Total CO2e emissions are calculated based on a life cycle assessment approach, following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines. The provided manufacturing emissions are 350 kg CO2e. To estimate the total footprint, we've included upstream material extraction and processing, transportation and distribution, and end-of-life disposal. Material extraction and processing is estimated to contribute approximately 75% of manufacturing emissions, accounting for the energy-intensive nature of aluminum and other materials (estimated at 262.5 kg CO2e). Transportation and distribution are estimated at 15 kg CO2e, considering global supply chains. End-of-life disposal is estimated at 7.5% of manufacturing emissions (estimated at 26.25 kg CO2e). Summing these stages: 262.5 kg CO2e (Material Extraction & Processing) + 350 kg CO2e (Manufacturing) + 15 kg CO2e (Transportation & Distribution) + 26.25 kg CO2e (End-of-life Disposal) = 653.75 kg CO2e. These are estimations based on typical life cycle stages for electronic products and are indicative. Actual values may vary depending on specific supply chains, transportation distances, and end-of-life management scenarios. This calculation provides a comprehensive, though estimated, carbon footprint across the product's life cycle stages as per LCA methodologies."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 104.65,
    "explanation": "Based on the provided data, the manufacturing CO2e is given as 65 kg CO2e per kg of product. Assuming an approximate weight of 1.61 kg for a MacBook Pro 14-inch (common specification), the manufacturing emissions are calculated as 65 kg CO2e/kg * 1.61 kg = 104.65 kg CO2e. This calculation is limited to the manufacturing phase (Scope 1 & 2) as per the GHG Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/14044 guidelines, and uses the provided 'manufacturing_co2e_kg' value.  A complete life cycle assessment following PAS 2050 and ISO/TS 14067 would also include emissions from material extraction and processing, transportation and distribution, and end-of-life disposal (Scope 3), which are not provided in the input data and therefore not included in this calculation. Thus, this value represents a partial carbon footprint focusing solely on the manufacturing stage."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB",
    "co2e_kg": 15.0,
    "explanation": "Based on the provided data and following GHG Protocol Product Standard, ISO 14040/14044 LCA methodology, PAS 2050, and ISO/TS 14067 guidelines, the carbon footprint calculation is limited to the manufacturing phase as this is the only life cycle stage for which quantitative CO2e data (15 kg) is provided. The calculation includes Scope 1 & 2 emissions from manufacturing processes as detailed in the 'Manufacturing' data.  Other life cycle stages such as material extraction and processing, transportation and distribution, and end-of-life disposal, which are crucial for a complete LCA as per the mentioned standards, are not quantified due to lack of specific data. Therefore, the reported CO2e of 15.00 kg represents a partial carbon footprint, specifically for the manufacturing stage of the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB. A comprehensive LCA would require additional data on upstream (material extraction, processing, transportation) and downstream (distribution, use phase, end-of-life) emissions to provide a complete product carbon footprint."
