    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 350,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for a MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) are estimated based on the life cycle analysis of similar laptops. The main materials in a MacBook typically include aluminum for the casing, silicon for the chips, lithium-ion for the battery, and various plastics and metals for other components. According to recent LCA studies and Apple's own environmental reports, a typical MacBook Pro has a life cycle CO2e emission ranging from 300 to 400 kg. This estimate considers the production phase, which is the most significant contributor, followed by the use phase, transportation, and end-of-life management. The production of the aluminum casing and the silicon chips are particularly energy-intensive processes. The use phase assumes an average lifespan of 4 years with typical energy consumption patterns. Given the advancements in energy efficiency and Apple's commitment to using recycled materials, the estimated CO2e emissions for this model are approximately 350 kg, aligning with industry standards and recent data."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB",
    "co2e_kg": 350,
    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Max - 1TB are estimated based on a life cycle analysis that includes raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and end-of-life disposal. The main materials in a MacBook Pro typically include aluminum for the casing, silicon for the chips, lithium for the battery, and various plastics and metals for other components. Based on similar products, the aluminum casing contributes significantly to the emissions due to energy-intensive extraction and processing. The silicon chips and lithium battery also have high emissions due to complex manufacturing processes. The usage phase is considered with an average electricity consumption over a typical lifespan of 4-5 years, assuming average global electricity grid emissions. End-of-life emissions are considered with a focus on recycling and waste management. The estimate of 350 kg CO2e is derived from Apple's environmental reports for similar products and industry standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14040/44 for LCA. This estimate reflects the most recent data and methodologies available for electronic products."

    "explanation": "The CO2e emissions for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro 512GB are estimated based on a life cycle analysis that includes raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and end-of-life disposal. The main materials in a MacBook Pro typically include aluminum for the casing, silicon for the chips, lithium for the battery, and various plastics and metals for other components. Based on similar products, such as previous MacBook models, the emissions from raw material extraction and manufacturing are significant contributors, often accounting for over 70% of total emissions. The usage phase, assuming an average lifespan of 4 years with typical energy consumption, contributes to the remaining emissions. The end-of-life phase is considered with recycling processes that mitigate some emissions. Reference factors from the Electronics Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol were used to estimate the emissions, with adjustments for the latest technological advancements and energy efficiencies in the M4 Pro chip. The total estimated CO2e emissions for the entire life cycle of this product are approximately 350 kg."
