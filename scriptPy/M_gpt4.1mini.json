    "product_name": "iPhone 16 128GB",
    "co2e_kg": 70,
    "explanation": "The iPhone 16 128GB is a modern smartphone with typical materials including aluminum, glass, plastics, rare earth elements, and lithium-ion battery components. Based on life cycle assessments of similar smartphones, the total carbon footprint includes raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, usage, and end-of-life phases. Material composition is roughly 30% aluminum and other metals, 20% glass, 15% plastics, 10% battery materials, and the rest electronics and packaging. Emission factors from international protocols such as the GHG Protocol and IPCC guidelines estimate around 55-75 kg CO2e per smartphone. Manufacturing and assembly contribute approximately 60% of emissions, raw materials 25%, transportation 10%, and usage plus end-of-life 5%. Given the iPhone 16's advanced manufacturing and energy-efficient design, a mid-range estimate of 70 kg CO2e is appropriate."

    "explanation": "The iPhone 16e 128GB is a modern smartphone with typical materials including aluminum, glass, plastics, and rare earth elements. Based on life cycle assessments of similar smartphones, the total cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions average around 60-80 kg CO2e per device. This includes raw material extraction (approximately 30-40%), manufacturing and assembly (40-50%), transportation (5-10%), usage phase (minimal for smartphones), and end-of-life processing (5%). Emission factors are derived from international protocols such as the GHG Protocol and ISO 14067. Given the incremental improvements in manufacturing efficiency and materials for the latest iPhone model, an estimated value of 70 kg CO2e is appropriate for the full life cycle emissions of the iPhone 16e 128GB."

    "co2e_kg": 110,
    "explanation": "The iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) 256GB is a high-end tablet with a complex mix of materials including aluminum, glass, plastics, and rare earth elements. Based on life cycle assessments of similar tablets and smartphones, the total cradle-to-grave CO2e emissions typically range between 90 and 130 kg CO2e. The main contributors are raw material extraction (especially aluminum and rare earth metals), manufacturing processes, and the use phase electricity consumption. For this model, assuming approximately 30% aluminum and other metals, 20% plastics, 10% glass, and the rest electronics and battery materials, and using emission factors from the IPCC guidelines and Ecoinvent database (e.g., aluminum ~8-12 kg CO2e/kg, plastics ~2-6 kg CO2e/kg, glass ~1-2 kg CO2e/kg), plus manufacturing and assembly emissions, the total estimated CO2e is about 110 kg. This includes an estimated 20-30 kg CO2e from the use phase over an average lifespan of 4 years, assuming typical electricity grid emissions. This estimate aligns with international protocols such as ISO 14040/44 and the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology."

    "product_name": "MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB)",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "The MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 (512GB) is a high-performance laptop with a typical lifespan of around 4-5 years. Life cycle analysis (LCA) studies for similar laptops estimate total cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions in the range of 150-250 kg CO2e, depending on materials, manufacturing, and supply chain specifics. Key contributors include aluminum casing (about 30-40% of weight), lithium-ion battery, printed circuit boards, silicon chips, and other electronic components. Emission factors used are based on international LCA databases such as Ecoinvent and protocols like ISO 14040/44 and the GHG Protocol. The aluminum casing production is energy-intensive, contributing roughly 60-80 kg CO2e. Semiconductor manufacturing and assembly add another 50-70 kg CO2e. The battery and other components contribute the remainder. Given Apple's focus on renewable energy in manufacturing and supply chain improvements, the estimate is adjusted to approximately 200 kg CO2e for the entire product life cycle up to the factory gate."

    "explanation": "The MacBook Air 15-inch with M4 (256GB SSD) is a modern laptop primarily composed of aluminum, glass, plastics, and electronic components including semiconductors and batteries. Life cycle analysis (LCA) studies for similar laptops estimate cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions around 150-250 kg CO2e, depending on materials, manufacturing, and supply chain. Key contributors include aluminum casing (high energy intensity in aluminum production, approx. 10-15 kg CO2e per kg), semiconductor manufacturing (high energy use), and battery production (lithium-ion batteries typically contribute 50-100 kg CO2e per kWh capacity). Given the 256GB SSD (solid-state drive) and the M4 chip (advanced semiconductor), emissions are on the higher side of typical ultrabooks. Using international protocols such as ISO 14040/44 and emission factors from Ecoinvent and IPCC AR6, the estimated total CO2e is approximately 200 kg.

    "product_name": "iMac (two ports) 256GB",
    "co2e_kg": 200,
    "explanation": "The iMac (two ports) 256GB falls under the Computers category, which typically has a life cycle CO2e emission range of approximately 150-250 kg CO2e based on international LCA studies such as those from the European Commission's Product Environmental Footprint and the Green Electronics Council. The main contributors to emissions are raw material extraction (aluminum, glass, plastics, and rare earth metals), manufacturing processes, transportation, usage phase electricity consumption, and end-of-life treatment. Given the relatively small storage capacity (256GB) and minimal ports, the device likely uses less material and energy than higher-end models. Assuming a material composition of roughly 40% aluminum and glass, 30% plastics, and 30% electronic components, and applying average emission factors (aluminum: ~8-12 kg CO2e/kg, plastics: ~2-3 kg CO2e/kg, electronics: ~50-70 kg CO2e/kg per kg of components), plus usage phase emissions estimated over a 4-year lifespan with average electricity grid emissions (~0.4 kg CO2e/kWh) and typical power consumption (~30W active, 5W standby), the total life cycle emissions are estimated at about 200 kg CO2e. This estimate aligns with international protocols such as ISO 14040/44 and the GHG Protocol Product Standard."
